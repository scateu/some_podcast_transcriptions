I Love This Bar

11
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:06,048
We live in a democracy with three branches and it you got the executive branch

12
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:09,632
The legislative branch in the judicial branch that third branch

13
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,168

00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,440
Huge

22
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,256
Every time we turn on the TV

00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,560
From losing our fundamental rights in this country

24
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:44,960
Cuz you we aren't election in the phrase that you hear a lot

25
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:52,896

4 Supreme Court Justices

27
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,040
Never mind that most Americans have no idea

Doesn't matter

31
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,144
We all know that whoever they are they're incredibly powerful people

32
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:20,288
Did they can instantly strike down a law that took years to pass Primm Court reversed

00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,176
They can undo executive orders they can even change

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,928
Ghettos of the possible corrupt

Presidential City

42
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,656
Now with all the background chatter in the election it's so interesting to think about

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,448
The fact that

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,776
When it comes to the court in their power it didn't have to be this way

45
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,568
Have to be this way

46
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
And it wasn't

47
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,408
For a long time and it wasn't for a long time

48
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,456
Yeah Boy Kelsea Padgett will take it from here

49
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,784
I mean if you go back in time so you like early 1800

50
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,344
Court had so little power

51
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,672
They were meeting in the basement of Congress

52
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,000
That's a Linda monk constitutional scholar one

53
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:16,096
Newspaper refers to it later as a dark dank potato hole

54
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:21,472
A potato look like a swamp

55
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:26,592
Imagine there were spiders in there and they said there were windows

56
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:32,992
Maybe it wasn't that bad but still we think of three separate branches it's kind of hard to think of yourself as a separate Branch when your me

57
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
Reading in the basement of Congo

58
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,600
Not only that would Congress actually sets up

59
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,136
First Supreme Court

60
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,464
They created originally a supreme court of

61
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
Sex

62
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,256
Justices

63
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,096
That's your law professor akhil Reed Amar even number

64
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
How

65
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
Odd

66
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,192
Dates for freaked out over the court

67
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:58,592
Divided for for what's going to happen oh my God

68
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,896
Into function with an even number of just

69
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:07,296
You know where we're at

70
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,624
Originally the first Congress they created

71
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,184
Sixth member cuz they're not imagining

72
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
The court as deciding everything

73
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
You know the court split

74
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
Who cares

75
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,631
Because at the time they weren't deciding big

76
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,215
Case if they were deciding like affirmative action Roe v Wade nothing like that

77
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,543
They're really like he's a little tiny rinky-dink cases

78
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,431
And most of their time was spent literally riding in carriages from town to town

79
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,967
Trying cases around

80
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,039
The country and that's a big hassle they don't even get to sleep

81
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,623
In their own bed why are they riding around with so

82
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
Actually

83
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Chatous

84
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,975
Separate geographical Zone

85
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:53,375
But they're in charge of that's actually still true today but I'm like today wouldn't went where people you don't come to the Supreme Court

86
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,935
Back then people were coming

87
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,287
That's a lie I'll install are legal

88
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
Why what

89
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,383
Seek out these guys someplace else

90
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,175
To hear my local issue

91
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,271
In South Carolina if they have something to say about it they can come South Carolina

92
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
Sit on my farm

93
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
And talk to me

94
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,367
Got to think about the country

95
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
In 1818 or 4

96
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
This is a state

97
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
Wright State

98
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,231
Eccentric

99
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,559
Which is to say that being a supreme court justices

100
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,607
The time is not a great gig

101
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
It's rough

102
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,191
Consequently the people who chose to do this

103
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
Well

104
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
Academy

105
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:37,919
Oh yeah I totally meant and who are like really smart but like a Motley Crew that isn't

106
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
Organize

107
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:45,087
Is a lawyer constitutional history enthusiasts pieces at the time on the court you had this one guy

108
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,647
Nicknamed old bacon face who has

109
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
Is like a maniac

110
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:55,327
He's like the kind of like Charlie Sheen Wild Thing in Major League type character very hot-tempered

111
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
Foul mouth

112
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,167
There's another one who

113
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,983
You know is like 4:55 and like really silent

114
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,543
The Supreme Court looks like a pretty rag-tag bunch

115
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
All of this happens and I think it's important

116
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,919
4 people understand all of this happens in part because

117
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,711
The Constitution is

118
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
Embarrassingly

119
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Silent

120
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,063
On what the Supreme Court is

121
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,343
What should you do

122
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
How it should be constituted

123
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,927
Article 3 says article 3 of our

124
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,023
There shall be a Supreme Court

125
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,911
Thanks guys

126
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:37,311
Like if you read the Constitution which spends a lot of time to talk about the House of Representatives how are you going to count slaves

127
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
Its and it's going to be by population

128
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
Census every 10 years

129
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
Cuz the house is important

130
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,455
When it comes to the Supreme Court

131
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
All you get is like a

132
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,295
Couple of sentences almost nothing

133
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
At all

134
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,183
That's kind of the puzzle of this like how did they get so powerful

135
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
I mean it started out as it's like

136
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
Nobody's

137
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
In a basement

138
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
And now they're these

139
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
All powerful

140
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,423
Priest

141
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
The Supreme Court

142
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
Of the United States

143
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
9 men

144
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
And women

145
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
Heian government

146
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,663
Who sit in judgment on many of the Great question

147
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
Before our nation

148
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:22,111
So how did that happen especially when there's like argue

149
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:27,743
Nothing in the Constitution that said that that should happen

150
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,815
You can trace so much of this

151
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
Back to one movie

152
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143
By one man

153
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,447
John Marshall John Marshall

154
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
The new

155
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
Chief

156
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Justice

157
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,031
He writes to the court

158
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,615
1801 Marshall glycolysis first meeting of the cord

159
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,039
And one person shows up

160
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,391
What do you mean the other

161
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,439
Actually it was three

162
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,511
Play before we go too deep it can you just like what do you look like

163
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
They all look

164
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
He didn't mean that he was tall

165
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,983
His square jaw

166
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
Piercing eyes Marshalls

167
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
It was a smart cookie

168
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,103
Any would need to be

169
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,383
Because he ends up getting in this

170
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,663
Very famous by

171
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,223
Which is very famous second cousin

172
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,599
That would change the course of the American history like forever

173
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
Well

174
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,927
Just a little man named

175
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
Thomas J

176
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:35,071
TJ now John Marshall and Thomas Jefferson

177
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
We don't like each other

178
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:44,031
You think Hamilton and Jefferson

179
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,591
Actually it was Marshall and Jefferson

180
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,895
Who really despised each other

181
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:54,271
And yet they both come from Virginia they both come from the backcountry

182
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,831
Why all the hate

183
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:03,231
Family beef at one point John Marshall's wife's mother rejected Thomas Jefferson

184
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
What

185
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,607
Yeah with his wife's mother Gaston his mother-in-law

186
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:14,751
Yeah to the great Thomas yeah I know but that doesn't seem like enough for a reason

187
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,543
The non gossip

188
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
Cuz they were in opposite political party

189
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,455
I think an important thing to understand about Marshall is that he's a party man

190
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,807
Okay party man likes to party

191
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,367
Committed to his team

192
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
His team is

193
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Are the federal

194
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
They love big

195
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
What time is National Bank

196
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,863
Rev up National Power the Republicans Thomas Jefferson's people

197
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
He likes

198
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,191
Small tiny government let the states have the

199
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:50,847
Or maybe even a favor The View that states can veto a federal law if they don't like it at least two guys please

200
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Two cousins

201
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
Both National figures

202
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
Totally different philosophies

203
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,479
Even before Marshall hits the court

204
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
They're going

205
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,623
Baby Fenty Beauty and the Beast actually a slugfest to paraphrase

206
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
Marshall you're dishonest

207
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:08,511
Jefferson you're a hack Marshall you and your friends are poisoning America dislike

208
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:14,143
That is a food fight it's very difficult to stop the tendency to view the people that you disagree with as

209
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,823
As Eve

210
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,127
You're really hard we do that today all the time right

211
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,711
They even as much if not more than today

212
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,527
They thought that the other side was trying to destroy

213
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
The Americas they just create

214
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
Anyway

215
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:43,839
Drive to 1790 the Federalist or empower the Federalist holes all the dino branches

216
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
John Adams

217
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,191
President mostly love poison party

218
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,727
Hated by Thomas Jefferson

219
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:54,591
They literally call him like his rotundity very offencive

220
00:10:54,847 --> 00:11:00,991
So out of the power and ultimately our guy John Marshall Marshall as Secretary of State when the highest officials in the oven

221
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,783
Station you know Hardiman

222
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,343
And for a while things are going well for his

223
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,367
Party

224
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
But then

225
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,207
18

226
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:16,607
Thomas Jefferson

227
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
Republican sweep in

228
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
Crush

229
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,751
Absolutely Crush

230
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
The Federalist

231
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
Like Landslide Crush

232
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Yeah

233
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Fleetwood Mac

234
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,711
The Republicans ran the table in 1800 they're going to take over the house

235
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
What do I do

236
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
We need to save the Republic

237
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,903
The Federalist have basically been swept out

238
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,951
But in his dire moment he has to say

239
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Idealista

240
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,791
How old is the White House

241
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
The Supreme Court

242
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,727
Supreme Court normally nobody cares about the Supreme Court but like in this moment you thinking oh my gosh this is my last hope

243
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,543
As luck would have it a vacancy pops

244
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,335
Avakin Chief just

245
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
Position

246
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,639
So just as

247
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,455
Majestically has recently died and there's a vacancy well

248
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:09,343
Sitting chief justice Oliver Ellsworth steps down and Adams picks his secretary of state

249
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
John Marshall

250
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
To be the new

251
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
Chief

252
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Justice

253
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,743
That's how we got John Marshall

254
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
And John Adams is one other thing

255
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,887
In the waning seconds of espresso

256
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:27,007
Adams and Eves repudiated Federalist jam through a whole bunch of federal judgeship

257
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:31,359
They create scores and new judges and they throw Federalist into almost all of this position

258
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:37,759
E-40 appointment he just throws in 40 judges right at the last minute to recreate sporty judges at the last minute and

259
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,599
Then he appoints Jefferson I would be

260
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,927
Ask Jordan is pissed a second

261
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,999
But in the meantime Adams have just a few days left in

262
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,815
His presidency so he's like frantically trying to get all these judges

263
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:55,935
Nominated people off confirm then once you confirm someone you have to let give them their Commission

264
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:00,543
You can just go around claiming you're a judge or claiming your paperwork

265
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
Formal seal

266
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,615
Signature of the president

267
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
End

268
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,223
As story goes as the clock is striking midnight on John Adams

269
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:13,599
Last day Adams is teen there in his office then try and get these papers out the door there

270
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,903
Frantically signing them stamping them

271
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:22,559
It's imagine like youngboy sprinting to the dead of night over their head

272
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:28,959
Like I think totally apocryphal story is that Jefferson's attorney-general like

273
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,239
Dorit midnight Netflix

274
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
Put down your pen

275
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:36,383
But apparently some of the commission's don't deliver

276
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
They just are left

277
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
Sitting on the dash

278
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,879
Because it wasn't like an oversight or something it's not even like

279
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,463
I thought like if a couple or left on the desk it's no big deal

280
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:56,863
It's a sign commission from the president it's like still a binding talking the fact that it wasn't formally delivered you know

281
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
You still get your

282
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
So

283
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,519
Kind of terrible situation for Jefferson he shows up the next day

284
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,871
To take power and the Judiciary is

285
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,943
Filled with ghosts of presidential appointees pass

286
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
Just a Bastion of

287
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
Partisan judge

288
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
So

289
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,671
As you can imagine

290
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,719
Jefferson and his friends think that this

291
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
This is not fair

292
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
Jefferson

293
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
Cease Marshall

294
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,863
And all of the other judges that Adams appointed

295
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,679
Adams is spies

296
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
On his

297
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
Administration

298
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,287
So Jefferson he decides to immediately retaliate

299
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,103
Cuz you know he won the presidency he won by a lot

300
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:43,199
He's like you're shoving all these judges down my throat and on top of that

301
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:48,831
We got your name to be the head of the judges the head of the Supreme Court is my evil second cousin War what is this

302
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,391
Joe Jefferson is running the country

303
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,231
Republican Congress to

304
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
Among other things

305
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:05,727
Cancel the Supreme Court term for 1802

306
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,263
Go home

307
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,079
Yeah they were like there's no more Supreme Court sorry

308
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,383
What happen today

309
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,783
What Obama's plan for immigration gets knocked out imagine him like instead of having like that peaceful press conference where he likes

310
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,831
Choses disappointment imagine instead he was like

311
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,623
Supreme Court

312
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,903
No good punks

313
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
That's right

314
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Anyhow

315
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:30,303
Marshalls in a way for over a year there's no. Rancourt meeting

316
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,839
And when he comes back

317
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
Pretty clear to him.

318
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,399
Supreme Court

319
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
It's on life support

320
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
At the Republicans

321
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:45,919
Pull the plug any minute Marshall knows already that there are there rumblin

322
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,223
That one of his colleagues a man named Chase

323
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Old bacon

324
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
You know

325
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,599
Backup should be impeached

326
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,719
So we see this Motley Crue in a dark tank potato

327
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
He's like

328
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
I got to do some

329
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,863
We're fighting for our life here

330
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,911
I was thinking about this on the way over

331
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,703
And it kind of reminds me of

332
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:15,103
You know there's a summer camp movies where there's a baseball team and they're like super ragtag and I can't get together

333
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:21,503
Like at the end they have to like play the really good team with the like the nice professional uniforms that's kind of like

334
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,343
The judges on the Supreme Court and Marshall

335
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:31,487
What is kind of like the counselor the camper you know with the new kid on the Block who who comes to the team is like

336
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
We can do this

337
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
You can do it

338
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:39,423
Q 80s movie training montage

339
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,079
He knows that the US is even going to have a court system

340
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:50,943
Supreme court Chief Keef this team up for the first thing that Marshal does is just

341
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,991
Professionalize

342
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
Did you ditch

343
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:58,623
He starts the tradition of wearing black robes

344
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,927
The part that judges appeared in their robes of just

345
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,743
She figured that the black robes would make them look

346
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,535
Westlake partisan hacks

347
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
And more like

348
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
There

349
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
Floating above the

350
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
The Fray

351
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,519
Beyond politics

352
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,455
Next moves all the justices into this one dorm the same rooming house

353
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:28,831
No wife no family all business trying to create that more perfect union

354
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,367
In the Judiciary

355
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
And just

356
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,439
To grease the wheels little bit

357
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
How to Madeira my dear

358
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:41,631
Is that someone yes but it's a fortified wine

359
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,703
Justice Marshall would order it in Great quantity

360
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,287
That many scholars think was part of John Marsh

361
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,919
Okay so he's professionalizing teams get them together

362
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,199
And then they get put to

363
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
318

364
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,807
It's a cousin on cousin smack

365
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
That's coming up

366
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,487
We continue

367
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
More perfect

368
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,335
JM Chatham Rod this is more perfect

369
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,151
Back to our story from Kelsey Padgett and we arrive at the

370
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
Pivotal moment

371
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,967
Cousin on cousin SmackDown.

372
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
Change America

373
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,063
Okay so remember I already told us that some of those

374
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
Commissions didn't get delivered

375
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,391
5 and that they were just

376
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,975
Like sitting on a desk somewhere and how they thought it wasn't a big deal

377
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
Because

378
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,791
It's still a binding document

379
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,815
When Jefferson comes to

380
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Power

381
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
Apparently he

382
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
Find

383
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
A person is like oh

384
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
Look at this

385
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,471
Deliver these commissions

386
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,519
Guess you can't get those positions

387
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,847
Sorry what are the people that

388
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:59,455
Lost out because their commission did not get delivered was 1mr William Marbury

389
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
This businessman

390
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
39

391
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
Ears

392
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,343
Age to be Justice of the Peace

393
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,391
It's a pretty low ranking position

394
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,487
So he's sitting there he's waiting for his commercial show up like of course it never does and it

395
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,023
Finally Dawns on him like

396
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,047
Oh

397
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,095
The Jefferson Administration has it

398
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,167
I'm going to go get it

399
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,007
So and what he does actually end up being really important

400
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,055
But he files a lawsuit directly in the Supreme

401
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,895
But you can do that you can just go right to this report

402
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,455
My first time at this time

403
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,503
Congress has just passed a law that said the

404
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,527
Why can certain

405
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,343
Restring circumstances you can just go directly

406
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,927
He goes directly to Supreme Court and he says I have a

407
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,975
I have a legal right

408
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
I want

409
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,791
US Supreme Court

410
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,167
Order Thomas Jefferson give me that darn piece of paper that says I'm really a judge

411
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,959
The case gets name Barbara B Mann

412
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:59,615
Because James Madison is Jefferson Secretary of State

413
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,663
Forcing Marshall in the courts to

414
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,967
Have this confrontation with Jefferson

415
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,319
So now it's The Showdown it's between Marshalls ragtag team and Jeff

416
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,951
So basically what happened is

417
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
Deborah has a trial

418
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:23,167
Marines lawyers to get up there and they're like what happened did you have

419
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:29,567
Damn what you do with it

420
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:35,199
Twitch marbury's lawyers are like seriously these are all important official document signed by the president like

421
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:41,599
No one knows what happened

422
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,647
To their credit like no one like a sponge

423
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
Doubt

424
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,951
Official eBay

425
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,767
Stop arguing about whether or not the papers

426
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,583
Exist and they're like this is the more important question

427
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,983
Does the Jefferson Administration have to honor those papers do they have to give the commission to Marburg are they required

428
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,287
Is there a legal requirement that they give it to him

429
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,639
Any Marshalls had it several sounding hell yeah he should have gotten that Commission

430
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,431
Cuz the law is the law

431
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,479
You decide you're not going to follow logic

432
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,039
Cuz you don't like the guy who made the law

433
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
Fair

434
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,159
I mean that we talked a lot in this country

435
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,208
We Pat ourselves on the back of the sky

436
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,768
About our peaceful transfer of power

437
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,632
Elie mystal again how we seamlessly can go from one party to the other party

438
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,936
Without Bloodshed in the streets and whatever

439
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,984
Good for us

440
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,032
How do we actually get to that point

441
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,336
And this is a key reason why we

442
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,664
Because the decisions of the past administration

443
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,736
Still hold value even when that Administration

444
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,528
Is kicked out of office

445
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
Overthrown

446
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,088
By popular vote

447
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
Their decision

448
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,184
Still have still have sway still have a legal Force

449
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,232
Jefferson was

450
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:52,768
White

451
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,792
Obviously

452
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,584
Negating that

453
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,656
Marshall wants to say that a person you know

454
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
Suck it up cousin

455
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,240
Give this guy his papers official

456
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
Do your job

457
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
But he thinks twice

458
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
She understands how weak

459
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,360
1480 alkmaar

460
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,432
Marshall's afraid that if he orders Jefferson to give over those papers

461
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:15,040
Jefferson is going to straight up laughing his face and say you and what army I'm not going to do it

462
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,856
Literally they just got back from a

463
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:22,720
Congressionally mandated you can't come to work time Jefferson nose

464
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Bulwell

465
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,304
But he has no intention of granting that

466
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,096
He will never

467
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
Give that

468
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,144
Jefferson nose

469
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
Marshall Motors

470
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,472
Marshall knows if he tell Jefferson

471
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:38,592
To give him the commission Jefferson is going to ignore him and in the power of the Supreme Court

472
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
Basically evaporate

473
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,456
Ellie says like if you think about it

474
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:49,600
If executive branch is going to say kind of right at the jump it if you make a decision that I don't like I'm just going to ignore that

475
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,648
Then every executive branch

476
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,952
Going on from Jefferson

477
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,024
Throughout the rest of our history is going to just ignore this

478
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,328
Supreme Court when the Supreme Court.

479
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
That the executive.

480
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,400
So basically Marshall

481
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
Pasta

482
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,080
If you rules for Jefferson he's selling out the lot he's going to make

483
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
The court look weak

484
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,664
Heroes against Jefferson

485
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,456
Jefferson can ignore the court

486
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
And

487
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,248
They're going to look weak

488
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,552
Either way Jefferson

489
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
And by the way

490
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
Supreme Court

491
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,160
Maybe disappears forever

492
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,232
Marshall needed to find a way

493
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,536
I'm to get through that he needed to

494
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,072
Find some way to kick this case

495
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,864
To be clear John Marshall

496
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,680
Running away from a fight with Thomas Jefferson

497
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,216
He says all true thing

498
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,496
He knows the times Jeff

499
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,800
Since you know straight up has more power

500
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,080
And so he's retreating

501
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,664
Wow it's like suddenly feels like apocalyptical moment

502
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,480
What does he do well so the thing that he does

503
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
It's like

504
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
The most

505
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,576
Jedi Master s thing ever

506
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,000
How did something page decision in in the beginning

507
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,304
It's a lot of pages

508
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,120
How is wrong

509
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
How he can't do what he did

510
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,032
How he is ruining America

511
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,592
A lot of that in the Marshall decision

512
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:17,152
But then when he gets to the matter at hand

513
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,456
He doesn't little

514
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,504
Ship

515
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,320
She says okay hold up yes

516
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,648
Barbary is right you should have gotten that Commission

517
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:31,488
And yes mr. Jefferson should not be doing this

518
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,048
We the Supreme Court jurist

519
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
To hear that

520
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,424
Court needs to have the power to hear a case

521
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,240
If a court doesn't have the power to hear a case

522
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,056
Even if you were completely right

523
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,592
Even if your position is

524
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,384
You can't get relief

525
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,712
Wait why would he say that they don't have jurisdiction

526
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,040
This is like where he uses the force

527
00:24:55,296 --> 00:25:00,160
You know earlier I mentioned that Marbury brought this case under a law Congress has passed

528
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,464
It's at Marbury to come straight to the

529
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,512
Work like for this kind of situation

530
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
Well

531
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,328
John Marshall he goes back to the

532
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,936
Figure out like what he can do here

533
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,776
He finds his little sentence with article 3 section

534
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:20,384
Two in the Constitution that says like basically you're not supposed to go to the

535
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,200
Supreme Court first you're supposed to go to a different

536
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
And then

537
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:30,112
Of course it's an appeals court exactly but but he basically tells Marbury the point

538
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,672
You came in and you came to the Supreme Court first

539
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
And

540
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:38,816
You did that because Congress passed a law that said that you could come to the Supreme Court first

541
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
But

542
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,632
The Constitution says

543
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,912
That you can't come to

544
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,936
Supreme Court first

545
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,216
So I can't help you

546
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,544
Is that your fault mr. Marbury but that law was unconstitutional

547
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,848
And we're not going to follow that.

548
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
Digital director

549
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,152
Si see what you did there

550
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:01,856
Maybe I see I don't know in Star Wars

551
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:05,184
The first one where Obi-Wan Kenobi is fighting with Darth Vader

552
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,072
He says

553
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144
This like that

554
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,680
But real

555
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,240
Marshall is agreeing to lose

556
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,032
He's like found this way to lose

557
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:25,408
Like let Darth Vader strike them down to make it more powerful he's basically saying to his cousin

558
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,968
Okay you don't have to give her a breeze

559
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Commission

560
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:33,344
And the reason you don't have to give Barbara his commission is his cuz that law doesn't work

561
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,624
Because we

562
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,648
The court

563
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,440
We get to decide

564
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,744
When something agrees with or doesn't agree with console

565
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
So like to grass

566
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
You win

567
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,096
Cousin by the way

568
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:50,496
We the court have the power to declare things unconstitutional that was the sort of Jedi Master

569
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,544
For laying down to the right

570
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,944
He establishes a new rule of the game unconstitutional

571
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,576
Inside this morning

572
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,648
Highly technical highly political

573
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,440
Drama between these two cousins

574
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,976
John Marshall

575
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,512
Sneaks in

576
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
An atomic bomb

577
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,096
This incredible power

578
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:23,776
In Marshall's decision he wrote is synthetically the dude in province of the judicial Department to say what

579
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:30,176
The law is say what the law is say what the law is and with those words he made the court would have

580
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
What is today

581
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,344
US Supreme Court ruled Monday along that would Americans born in Jerusalem Israel

582
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,744
The place of birth is unconstitutional is unconstitutional

583
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,536
Constitutional fun Constitution

584
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,888
And no one has ever done that before well I mean like people talked about it

585
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
Theories about it

586
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,520
The first time

587
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,056
The Supreme Court.

588
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,872
In the face of the president

589
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:07,040
Ernesto a Miranda petitioner vs Arizona against the United

590
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,344
And that's how it is on this path

591
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,672
New York Times company petitioner vs lb

592
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,952
Today

593
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:19,072
What is so much more powerful it's grown into the 800-pound gorilla when it

594
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,352
Simon Says jump

595
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,632
Other branches

596
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,656
Tend to say

597
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:27,776
How high

598
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
Take you for granted

599
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:34,432
Three words Bush V Gore they decide the presidential election and and no one blinks

600
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,720
Mr. Bento

601
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:53,120
Yeah yeah yeah I know you could be excited for me clothes you could reasonably argue that Marbury versus Madison was

602
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,400
Not the big moment

603
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,704
When the court got its power because

604
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,520
It really depends on what you mean when you say power

605
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,152
I guess we were talking with our legal editor Elena Stalin

606
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,712
Constitutional scholar

607
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,016
They both said like look what happens after this case

608
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,064
30 years down the road is

609
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,344
John Marshall

610
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,672
Still the Chief Justice he gets into a dust-up with Andrew Jackson

611
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,232
Message Jackson were talking about so generally it was

612
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,560
I would like to do horrible things Native Americans

613
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,120
You probably shouldn't do horrible things the Native Americans

614
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,984
I don't remember asking you a god

615
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,264
Damn thing

616
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:37,920
Essentially had a situation where Marshall makes ruling saying we have to respect Native American sovereignty and Jackson family

617
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,456
Supposedly

618
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
That we don't know if

619
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,784
True I think it's more fun to believe that

620
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
Did say that

621
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
It works better than me

622
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,184
Now let them enforce it

623
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,280
John Marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it

624
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:59,424
To make a long sad story short you get the Trail of Tears thousands of Native Americans were marched off their land

625
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:05,824
There's evidence that they were purposefully move during the winter so that more people would die along the way so well

626
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,360
The court maybe had constant

627
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,664
2-channel Authority it didn't have a key

628
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
Actual power

629
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,344
Until or just got here on this and that the students are in the 1950s

630
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,416
Court orders school to desegregate they don't

631
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:26,816
And the president sends in the troops

632
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:30,400
National Guardsmen

633
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
Playing boots on the ground

634
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,960
Force

635
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
Still so often comes down

636
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
2

637
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
And exactly

638
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,104
Willing to putt

639
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,152
Boots on the ground

640
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,688
In order to enforce

641
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,504
That's on the power becomes real

642
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
Although maybe not

643
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,368
I don't know what time

644
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
Before I went to college

645
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,976
And eventually after hours

646
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,768
Austin College where things were not

647
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
Separate

648
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,400
At one point is we're working on the story Elie talked to his mom and she told him that

649
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,704
When she was growing up in the mid-sixties

650
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,496
Years after

651
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,800
More than a decade

652
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
Best brownie

653
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,896
You would still never know what happened no one would know it.

654
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:13,920
Clarksdale MS

655
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
Mississippi

656
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:19,296
There was a public library but I was not allowed to go to that Library

657
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,088
My father

658
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
Who was China

659
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,392
Could going

660
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,160
Into the library

661
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,464
So many times I sit in the car

662
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,000
What that one

663
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,048
The library to get a book that I want it

664
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,888
And this is this is after the passage of the Civil Rights Act

665
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
Yes

666
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,472
Shanghai

667
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,496
School I graduated

668
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:39,776
7

669
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
Just

670
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,360
Yesterday as a recording this

671
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,176
Icourt had to issue

672
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:50,528
How to issue another ruling ordering a town in Mississippi

673
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,064
Desegregate its schools

674
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,112
Yeah that didn't happen

675
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,904
5 years ago

676
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,184
Yesterday man

677
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,208
Yesterday

678
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
The courts

679
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,512
Can make these laws

680
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
But if the people

681
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,120
Aren't willing to go along with

682
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
With and what do these laws mean

683
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,008
I think ultimately I agree with learning Han

684
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:15,872
He was a judge in New York in the early nineteen hundreds

685
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,688
Too much upon laws and courts in concert

686
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,968
Tatoosh ins that these are

687
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
False hopes

688
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,112
Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women and when it dies there no law no court no cost

689
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,136
Teaching and save it

690
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:32,256
Indian For Better or Worse

691
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,704
We the people still have the power

692
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:59,392
Okay so why do we call this podcast we called it

693
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,696
As it turns out

694
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
The top

695
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,768
Vast majority of Americans like 60

696
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,536
He 6%

697
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,328
Cannot name a single Supreme God

698
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
For justice

699
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:12,704
We also found them when we went out and a lot of people had no idea how many justices

700
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,728
There are

701
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,032
Do not know how many Supreme Court justices

702
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:22,432
17 Supreme Court judges

703
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,736
12/9

704
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,016
9 yes

705
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,856
We think we should know about these people

706
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
We should at least

707
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
Know their names

708
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,440
So the title of this podcast

709
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
Is a mnemonic device

710
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,280
To help you remember the names

711
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,304
Names of the justice

712
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,352
This is so their last names are

713
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,912

Roberts

717
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:51,104
Alito and Sotomayor and Merrick Garland get Sandoval's

718
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,128
Garland

719
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:56,992
Cake and Kennedy Thomas Ginsburg Breyer Roberts Toledo Sotomayor maybe Garland

720
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:03,392
So first letter last name cake 80GB Ras maybe cheap what if they turn them to song

721
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,928
Help you remember

722
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,072
Kittens kick the giggly blue robot

723
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,632

Maybe

730

God damn

731
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:37,696
Can you get the Game of Thrones robot

732
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,976
Maybe

733
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,000
God damn

734
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,912
Ready

You can find that song on a website radiolab.org more perfect

738
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,168
