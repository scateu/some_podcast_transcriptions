00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Listener-supported WNYC

00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,424
Be Studios

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,872
A more perfect people

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,688
I know you haven't heard from us in a while

5
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:22,784
A new season is on its way it's going to be a very interesting special different

6
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:25,600
Kind of situation for us than the first two seasons

7
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,928
Will dropping by today because

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,768
Supreme Court is made of hard came up with a really big controversial

9
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,536
Decision

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,352
Court upheld President Trump's travel ban

11
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,680
It was a split decision 5 to 4

12
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,728
Like so many decisions these days

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,264
But both sides

14
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:49,152
Name dropped this one particular Supreme Court case from back in 1944 at the korematsu

15
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,176
Decision

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,968
The majority

17
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:56,064
Said korematsu's got nothing to do with the travel ban The Descent

18
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
Sad

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,368
Yeah it does

20
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:04,768
This decision is just like korematsu the court now is using the same dangerous logic that use back then

21
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,792
If you

22
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,072
Haven't already

23
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,144
You can meet korematsu for yourself

24
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056
We actually started off season 2 with this story from producer Julie Longoria that takes a look the korematsu

25
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
To decision

26
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,384
The guy behind it

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,736
In light of today's decision

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
It

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,064
My penis sting listen

30
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,624
Producer Julia Longoria start this off

31
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,120
The year is 1967 and the place

32
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:47,520
Is San Lorenzo High School in East Bay of California

33
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,592
And we're in a US History classroom

34
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,992
I was actually a junior in high school this is Karen korematsu I'm the executive

35
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:02,880
Director and founder of the Fred T korematsu Institute in San Francisco so on this particular day

36
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:08,256
Karen is sitting at the back of the classroom and our teacher had assigned each of

37
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:15,168
My classmates a little paperback book to read you know books about American history government in the US

38
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,192
Assignment was to

39
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
I get up in front of the class and give an oral book report that mean this is a long time ago so that's the way they used to do things

40
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:29,760
I don't even remember what my my book was are my subject but Karen said she was just sitting there and class list

41
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,576
Listening as one by one classmate Scott up

42
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:37,696
Talk about George Washington or Abraham Lincoln or whatever and then my friend

43
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:44,352
Maya who is Japanese-American 3rd Generation like myself got up in front of the class

44
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,192
And her book was called concentration camps USA

45
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,032
About the Japanese-American internment

46
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,592
And I thought

47
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,944
No that's interesting I hadn't heard about that before

48
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,224
What's that about

49
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,528
Am I his book report went something like this

50
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:08,928
In 1941 the United States of America was attacked

51
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,232
The president's president

52
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:17,632
Roosevelt had to respond

53
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,656
Broadband

54
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,192
So in terms of Defense

55
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:26,080
One of the big questions for Roosevelt was what happens if the Japanese invade the continental US

56
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,664
America's founding

57
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,968
They probably come in on the West Coast

58
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,832
And you had more than a hundred thousand Japanese-Americans living on the West Coast

59
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,392
Like what they turn against the United States

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
They didn't know

61
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:47,072
And so her friend my explained to the class on February 19th 1942

62
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,144
President Roosevelt issued executive order 90066

63
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,496
That gave the military the authority

64
00:03:54,752 --> 00:04:00,896
To forcibly remove anyone of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast

65
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:06,016
She goes on to explain these the horrific circumstances and

66
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
How

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,184
120000 people of Japanese ancestry had been real forcibly removed from their home

68
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
She explained they were put into these

69
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,655
Detention camps really without any due process of law but then she went on to say but there was this one

70
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
Batman

71
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,239
Who refused to go to the camps

72
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:32,639
And he was arrested and he sue the government and took his case all the way to the Supreme Court

73
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
And then you became a landmarks

74
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
Supreme Court case

75
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,991
And that man's name

76
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
Is Fred korematsu

77
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Oh

78
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,367
I said to myself

79
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
That's my name

80
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,511
She says the class got really quiet

81
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,559
And I had

82
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,095
35 pairs of eyes

83
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
Turn around looking at me

84
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
Okay yes

85
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:59,263
She. My last name is korematsu my dad's name is Fred but no way

86
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,335
There's no way it's my dad someone would have told me

87
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
So

88
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,175
Corson I go running home and

89
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,479
Confronting my mother and asking her

90
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
What she say

91
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:16,415
Well I got the standard to answer wait till your father gets home and you can ask him

92
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:20,767
That voice you heard by the way was Elie mystal our legal editor and by the time he

93
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:27,167
I got home it was 8 in the evening and so that's a long time after you know 3:30 in the afternoon

94
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:31,007
And I come down a little bit and I asked him in and he said

95
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,335
It happened a long time ago

96
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,895
And what he did he thought was right

97
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
And the government was wrong

98
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,039
And it was at clear and simple

99
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,599
I could just see

100
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,183
This hurt going over his face and I just couldn't ask him

101
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
Any more questions

102
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:56,095
Karen says it wasn't until years later that she learned what really happened

103
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,399
And why her dad never wanted to talk about it

104
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
Well

105
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,567
I was 21 then

106
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,943
This is fred korematsu at stapleton from the densho archives

107
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,991
And I was up on the hill

108
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Sunday morning

109
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,087
My girlfriend on Fred story starts

110
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:22,463
Out on a date when you're that age you know you have a girlfriend just like anybody else

111
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,303
And she was more important to me than anything

112
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:32,703
Fred and his girlfriend Ida are driving in the Hills above San Francisco looking down on the city the Golden Gate Bridge

113
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,799
Bridge you've been dating this girl for a while now

114
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
Italian-American

115
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,407
Most of his friends were Caucasian we were in a car

116
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,479
And we were deciding what to do with such a nice day

117
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,783
If It Go picnicking or something like that

118
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,903
And then all sudden I heard

119
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:58,303
Pokemon are

120
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,119
Radio

121
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,751
Japanese Embassy

122
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,567
And I was quite shocked we both were

123
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:14,431
Fred knew there was a war on and that the US was likely to get involved

124
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,319
Even try to enlist in the US military but was denied because he was Japanese-American

125
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,879
This is sitting there one of his first thoughts was

126
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:28,767
Why does it have to be to pan some country was going to attack Pearl Harbor

127
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,047
I wish it was Russia

128
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,119
You know I just thought about that you know

129
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,703
I was bitter with the pan-fried having this happen

130
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,031
So I took her home

131
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
And then I went home

132
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,407
So

133
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
He gets home

134
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,735
Paintball shot

135
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,807
They're all sitting around the living room

136
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
The house is

137
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:58,975
Just in the spare his mom is in tears they were proud of being Japanese you know

138
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,511
They obey the law

139
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,071
They did everything that supposed to mean

140
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,863
To have this happen

141
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,655
I put them in chain

142
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,983
It was even hard to talk to them after that

143
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:16,127
Fred had a traditional immigrant Japanese-American families

144
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:22,527
His parents were born in Japan and then all his brothers were born here in the US born in Oakland California

145
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:26,879
He was the third out of four brothers and being the Third

146
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,415
At the 2nd to the 1st

147
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
That mattered absolutely

148
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:35,583
Fred wasn't unique position as the third son he could resist

149
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,703
We asked Lorraine Vani I teach at Seattle University School of Law for some contacts

150
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,103
Kiawah professor and a friend of Fred's family the cultural tradition is that the first son is the favorite son

151
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:53,503
The oldest was going to inherit the family garden and Nursery business II would help out with that business

152
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,343
Dad as a third son was very low on the totem pole

153
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:02,207
His parents didn't have the same expectations of him relatively speaking he was kind of the hook

154
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:09,375
Unlike his older brothers he didn't speak much Japanese and he felt more American than anything else

155
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:15,519
When I was in school we start each day for the Pledge of Allegiance I studied American history

156
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,079
I always been a good American citizen

157
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,151
So when he came home that Sunday when Pearl Harbor was attacked

158
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,967
Is family responsible whole thing was

159
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
Unsettling

160
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
I am

161
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
I didn't know what to do

162
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
And Fred says

163
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
Pretty soon after

164
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,415
Things got very weird

165
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,767
Within a few days I put spotlights on the whole Nursery at night

166
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,327
And they had a gun standing right now

167
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:45,727
Our home there around the fence there watching us cuz I went out one night to have a cigarette and I was saying on the

168
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,519
Parts of a cigarette

169
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,871
And God Yolanda if I was singling somebody

170
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
Ridiculous

171
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,503
Then came Roosevelt executive order

172
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,367
That big order 906 6

173
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,695
Authorized the military to make a series of smaller ones

174
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,743
The first set of orders was a curfew order

175
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
Saying that

176
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:12,095
Japanese Italians and Germans were subject to a curfew

177
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:17,215
Second order was a freeze order directed just at the Japanese on the West Coast

178
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:22,591
They weren't allowed to leave the area and then the third order wasn't ordered that they could not

179
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
We met

180
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,407
On the West Coast

181
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:31,807
Except for in the custody of an approved location by the army

182
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:36,415
They're about 15 of these assembly centers

183
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:42,815
Japanese-Americans were told to report to one of these centers by a certain date

184
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,935
Fred's family began to scramble to worry about what they were going to take

185
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:54,335
What was going to happen to the nursery and still expecting my mother you know the attention and

186
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,663
Worries so in the days before his family left

187
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:03,039
Fred made a decision

188
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:09,695
I am I had my own worries and I had mom girlfriend my own problems he decided not to go with his fam

189
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
I am

190
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,511
Doctor then bedtime

191
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,583
That I can want to

192
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
I won't leave with you

193
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,191
You didn't want to leave item behind

194
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,519
We thought maybe the two of them could make a break for it later on

195
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
Leave the state

196
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,847
Before the evacuation deadline

197
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,407
And

198
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,711
They said fine if you can do it

199
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
Go ahead

200
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,063
He was the third son

201
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,719
So he knew that his older brothers would be able to take care of the family and they said he was

202
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,279
Was a grown-up and he should make his own decisions

203
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,887
And so he did he went off and got his own apartment and his own job as a welder

204
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,191
I'm kind of lived under the radar

205
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:58,591
News brothers will be there to take care of his parents if you're with the family

206
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,407
Like my family or any Japanese family

207
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,991
You feel the pressure in the

208
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
Sadness

209
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,415
But on the outside is different just like a normal

210
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
What if you know

211
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,023
Just like we've been living all the time

212
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
I felt right at home

213
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,191
You know I'm an American citizen to you know

214
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,775
I didn't feel guilty

215
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:35,199
Cuz I don't think I did anything wrong. He was politically

216
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
Aware at this point

217
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,551
If you're asking me about whether he

218
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,879
Refuse to go as an act of political resistance

219
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
I don't think initially

220
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,975
Unconsciously he probably

221
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,815
Knew that what was happening to Japanese-Americans was wrong

222
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,167
But I don't think he had the words for that we might have today

223
00:12:55,935 --> 00:13:02,079
Is on his way home from work one day that he reads in the newspaper

224
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:06,943
Paper about his parents and all the other Japanese-Americans in the area being taken away to camp

225
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:13,343
Baby's sick to my stomach and on that I can see my parents going in you.

226
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:18,975
My brother's going to camp and I'm not there you know

227
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:25,375
But that was only time that I felt kind of

228
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:31,775
Lonely you know like what what am I going to do now you know

229
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,127
It begins to slowly down on him what he's done

230
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,479
By staying in the Bay Area he is officially breaking the law

231
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:45,599
And he and Ida aren't sure what that means like will they be thrown in jail or worse

232
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,415
He talks in the archives about how he's worried

233
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
And I was worried to

234
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,023
Because now he could get arrested

235
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,071
So they start to think about their options

236
00:13:55,327 --> 00:14:00,703
Fred decides to get an ID with a Spanish sounding last name on it so we won't be recognized as Japanese

237
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
And then

238
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,775
Ida says essentially

239
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
That might not be enough

240
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,895
She pulled out an article regarding plastic surgery

241
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,199
And

242
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,991
What do you think of this

243
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
I looked it over

244
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
And well

245
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
I didn't

246
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:22,719
I think it was a good idea but she said hey why don't you think about

247
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:27,327
That's this might be a good thing that will allow you to stay here

248
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,143
So the idea would be that he

249
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,959
You don't have his eyes doubled or something like that

250
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:37,055
A plastic surgery procedure where you put a fold in the eyelid

251
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,127
So you look more white less Japanese-American

252
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,919
Did you think I work

253
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,735
And that's I don't know

254
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Well

255
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,879
She said she'll be looking to it

256
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
And

257
00:14:53,951 --> 00:15:00,095
Why is it that I'm going to lose so we decide to try it

258
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:05,727
So Fred gets into his car and he drives into the city into San Francisco and he

259
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,055
Just stops in front of the doctor's office

260
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,663
Amsart spacing

261
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,759
Walking up the steps of this Victorian and then

262
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,111
Walking down the steps to leave and he was a really crummy idea and then

263
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
Walking back up the steps

264
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:28,511
Thinking well yeah maybe I just right it's a good idea and the down the steps

265
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,071
This is a ridiculous idea

266
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,911
Giving some doctor your hard-earned money to

267
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,471
Change your face

268
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,495
So it goes up

269
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,775
And down

270
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
And I

271
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
Turn down a notch

272
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,895
I'm down until

273
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
He decided to just

274
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
Going

275
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,783
Have a procedure done

276
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,087
He really did it as a way to

277
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,903
Protect them as they try to leave the state

278
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:02,559
The doctor said he was going to work on his eyes and then also fix a broken nose I had a broken nose

279
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,863
I'm playing football and I never had it fixed

280
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,655
And

281
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
So you could do a pretty good work on me

282
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,543
But it turned out he didn't do everything he said he would

283
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
Regis

284
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,871
Took my money that's what it was I join

285
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,431
There wasn't anything change except

286
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,247
I didn't have a broken nose anymore

287
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:27,391
So he drives back to the East Bay with a new nose but the same eyes

288
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:32,511
And shortly after that day at the doctor's office he's out buying cigarettes at a convenience store

289
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,559
Leclerc

290
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,399
Recognized him and reported him

291
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:43,007
And one day walking down the street he was stopped

292
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,287
And arrested

293
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
And

294
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:52,735
Spent his Memorial Day and 1942 in the San Leandro jail

295
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
When we got caught

296
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,599
They called her into

297
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
Yeah

298
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
And

299
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
I see the police chief

300
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,815
Talking to her for quite a while

301
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:15,519
I imagine it's a small jail and he's just been admitted so he's sitting in the lobby and he sees I to come into the front.

302
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:21,407
He's just out of earshot he can't make out exactly what they're saying but at a certain point

303
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
A stop talking

304
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,247
And she just walks out

305
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
So

306
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
That was the end of it

307
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,879
I never did see her again

308
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,983
They never saw each other

309
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:55,967
So you sitting there alone in the sea

310
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:01,855
San Leandro jail and they end up transferring him to Oakland jail for some reason and then he ends up at

311
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:06,719
The federal prison in San Francisco because resisting the order with a federal offense

312
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,255
Anyway

313
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,631
One day I got a call from the guard

314
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:20,287
And told me I had a visitor and I didn't know it was you know

315
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:26,687
I knew all my friends were in can't or they were in the military but Fred Goes Down to the visiting room anyway

316
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:31,551
And there's assman there

317
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,879
Well I believe in civil liberties

318
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:38,207
Right of people is being denied

319
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:44,863
This is something that I'm concerned about the man says his name is Ernest besic and then it was over

320
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,423
Easier to talk to me

321
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,519
He asked if I need some cigarettes or something like that you know

322
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:56,895
Just to break the ice by the way I asked him

323
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,943
Who do you represent

324
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,991
And Earnest response well

325
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:08,159
ACLU or something like that

326
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:14,559
We have no way of knowing what exactly was said between Fred and Ernest besig

327
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,607
Both men have passed away

328
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,471
But it seems like something important must have happened in this conversation because

329
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,055
If I was Lori Benitez I don't think he had the words

330
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,615
Or that we might have today Fred

331
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,639
Didn't have

332
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,967
Language of resistance before this moment

333
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,807
Something in that conversation must have given it to him

334
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,367
Because when Earnest Pathak asked him

335
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,695
Do you want me to represent you in a court of law

336
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
Fred says yes

337
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,095
What do you imagine the words were that

338
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,911
Might have turned him in that moment

339
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
Imagine

340
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
That

341
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,543
Method must have said to fraud

342
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,383
We think that what's happened to Japanese Americans

343
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,431
Is unconstitutional

344
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,967
We'd like to bring a lawsuit

345
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,015
To say the Japanese Americans

346
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,807
Are being sent away

347
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,343
Only because of their race

348
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,135
And in that

349
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,719
J-fred language

350
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:22,143
For what I think Fred knew was wrong

351
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:41,343
Basic try to get Fred out of jail but the military stepped in and said he had

352
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,135
How to join his family and camp

353
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,975
They were at a place called Tanforan race tracks

354
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,791
It was a temporary holding spot

355
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:54,655
So that meant that the first place that Fred went after jail was

356
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,823
A converted horse stall

357
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,639
The wind just blew in there no that's blue in there and everything

358
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:08,479
This was a small horse stall because Fred had asked for his own

359
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:14,111
Wanted to sit and think about what to say to his family to were also at Tanforan

360
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:20,512
Sat and looked at the single lone bear light bulb above and the smell of manure

361
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:24,608
Hey I mean it's ready for horses not for human beings

362
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,056
And then all sudden I hear a knock on the door

363
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,664
And I'll open it with my brother is hey you can't stay here

364
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
You got coming

365
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
Cedar Park

366
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,440
We walk spread over to the Star Wars families been living

367
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,816
And I was surprised the way they fixed up their stalls

368
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,352
They

369
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,656
Solar Paula cracks

370
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:03,776
And they put newspaper for the walls in the paper that all up

371
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,360
This was a common thing for these families

372
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:12,480
Thousands of them were transferred to more permanent camps and many stay there for up to 3 years

373
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,528
Overtime

374
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,832
The community

375
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,648
Kind of tried to build lives for themselves

376
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,952
You hear stories

377
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,232
MC pictures

378
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,072
People building small Japanese gardens

379
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,400
What they found in the area

380
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:35,264
She saw newsreels about the people who made the Desert Bloom

381
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:41,920
Eventually saw people

382
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,480
Farming you know baseball teams

383
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:14,688
My brother he was involved in various Japanese activities

384
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,992
And

385
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,576
He thought it might be a good idea for me to

386
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,696
Get some suggestions and opinions regarding to

387
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,024
If I should fight the case or not

388
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,632
So Phresh brother calls a meeting

389
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,448
You got about 30 young people together

390
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,264
Imagine it was f****** a mess hall or something like that

391
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,568
They discussed Frets case

392
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,592
They were

393
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,920
Discussion is to themselves or in little groups

394
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:51,296
And I stood around and waited for someone to speak

395
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,928
But no one actually came out to speak to me

396
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:14,592
I can see Fred kind of standing in a corner as people are gathered in small groups

397
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,896
Whispering to each other

398
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,712
Stealing glances at him

399
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:33,536
But no one says

400
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,864
The word to him

401
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:43,776
Finally one dead and you said Fred were undecided on

402
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
If I should find

403
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,336
Acacia not because

404
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,384
They don't want to

405
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,456
Make any more disturbance

406
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,528
Anything to upset

407
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,344
The parents right at the time because they were

408
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,672
To upset already and think just being in Camp

409
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,232
I told them their parents have been through enough

410
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,024
Leaving their lives behind

411
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
Basically they said

412
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,120
We can't help you

413
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:20,128
But there was one Japanese American group that did decide to say something about Fred's case

414
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,920
What's the name of the group

415
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Jas

416
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
CL

417
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,040
Ernest message had a nickname for this group

418
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,088
The Japanese-American Citizens League

419
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,624
The jackals

420
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
I meant

421
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,976
With a leadership of that group

422
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,256
Several of them

423
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,536
I purged them

424
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,328
To oppose

425
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,608
The explosion

426
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:44,704
But they didn't seem to be particularly interested

427
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,520
The JCL condemned Frets case

428
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,080
And anyone else who fought against the government orders

429
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:54,432
Said it would not support any of these individuals were fighting the orders

430
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,968
And called them

431
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,248
Self-styled martyrs

432
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,296
Wow that use that phrase

433
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,064
Yes

434
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,648
They would basically get everyone else into trouble

435
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,976
To do this by myself

436
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,280
I just wonder if I was doing wrong or

437
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,096
I'll maybe putting them in Shame by

438
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,144
I'm bringing the issue up again

439
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:22,592
Because of Japanese people lay their peaceful people when they they like to leave things alone if they can

440
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,968
Because they were in enough trouble as it is because of this Pearl Harbor attack

441
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,528
And the country blame them

442
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,600
So they have the sort of a guilty complex

443
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,904
Even though

444
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,696
They have nothing to do with it

445
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:45,632
Majority I'm just avoided me so therefore I assume that

446
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
That

447
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,104
I got myself in this problem

448
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,896
And

449
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:01,248
That was my problem in the end not theirs

450
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:10,208
Fred continue to fight his case he argued that basically rounding up

451
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:16,608
Thousands of Japanese-Americans American citizens without a trial without due process

452
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:21,216
Basically amounted to racial discrimination

453
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:27,616
Is case made its way up and down the courts and eventually two and a half years

454
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,920
After he met unexpected in that jail cell

455
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,968
The case arrives

456
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,760
At the Supreme Court

457
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,856
Yo he thought that by the time his case got to the Supreme Court

458
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,160
That's Fred's daughter Karen again he would

459
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:44,256
Be able to vindicate his family and everyone that had been incarcerated

460
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,816
And that's how much he believed in the Supreme Court

461
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,936
And so when that didn't happen he felt like

462
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,008
If he felt like it was his fault

463
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,592
It's a big bird to carry around

464
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,688
What ends up happening is

465
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,504
On December 18th 1944

466
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,784
The Supreme Court

467
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
Rules against Fred

468
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
It's kind of a

469
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,392
Complicated decision

470
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
The Supreme Court said

471
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,976
Racial distinctions

472
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,024
When the government is making racial

473
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
Addiction is serious

474
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,864
We need to look at this very very carefully

475
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,424
And that was a big president

476
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
Sun a lot of ways

477
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
It's

478
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,752
Kind of

479
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,824
Victory for people fighting racial discrimination

480
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,384
But then the court turned around and said

481
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,968
Even though racial distinctions are serious

482
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,248
This one

483
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
Is not

484
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,320
Strictly racial

485
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,648
We are at war with the Japanese empire there for

486
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,208
Rounding up Japanese-American Citizens

487
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
Is a way to

488
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,280
Defend the nation

489
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,400
Kind of your friend at this point

490
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:58,240
Like it sounds like it sounds like lonely and then I can almost imagine because you're

491
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
Your

492
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,032
By yourself

493
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,824
Pretty-much on all fronts

494
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:07,968
The country that you feel so a part of that you want to actually enlist in the military to fight for

495
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,016
Doesn't seem to want you at that moment

496
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,320
Your own Community doesn't seem to want you

497
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,856
Your family

498
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,392
It's a Shame by you

499
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,440
Your girlfriend

500
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,720
Is gone

501
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,560
I can't imagine being more alone at this point

502
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,120
Any never shared that with my brother I

503
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,424
He shared it with my mother

504
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,008
But but we didn't that wasn't part of our Peg dinner conversation

505
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,928
We did it during World War II

506
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,584
You know

507
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:05,824
What is speed

508
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,432
This is the crazy thing about the korematsu decision

509
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,200
It is

510
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,736
Still on the books

511
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:17,344
That guy Carl Higbie got on Megyn Kelly and

512
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,368
Said this

513
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:22,720
Stuff about korematsu in the very next day he got on and apologize for saying that

514
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,000
But he's right

515
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,072
Korematsu is technically still good law

516
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,608
Justice Antonin Scalia

517
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,888
One said

518
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,704
That sherp korematsu was wrongly decided

519
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,520
But if you think that it's not going to happen again

520
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,056
You're kidding yourself

521
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:40,384
The car isn't going to get across the president

522
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,176
An international America

523
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,040
Would you like us to

524
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,088
I think so

525
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,392
You would you like it

526
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:52,928
No

527
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,512
That's not injured in school yet it's a judge named Richard Posner

528
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,608
Not the time that we talked to him he was on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals

529
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,656
He was widely considered by

530
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:07,264
People on both the left and the right to be one of the most influential judges in the country

531
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,824
He sometimes called the 10th Supreme Court Justice

532
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:14,176
And he's a big defender of the korematsu decision

533
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:19,296
What do you say then to Fred korematsu what do you say then to to a Japanese-American about

534
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,344
Kind of the law and the courts

535
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,904
Well they were given compensation

536
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,000
Right I mean Thursday

537
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:33,888
There is no pain suffering there is there there's an anguish right that we can

538
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,424
Exactly commodify

539
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,240
Yeah but

540
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,056
At the time it all happened

541
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,616
Shortly after Pearl Harbor

542
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:48,736
It seemed like the right thing to do and probably was the right thing to

543
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
And I imagine that

544
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
The officials and

545
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,904
Federal government in

546
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,440
1941

547
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:02,560
They probably didn't know anything about Japanese-Americans on the West Coast

548
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:06,912
Roosevelt ever compared to Japanese-American doubt it

549
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,680
Like I just

550
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,704
Thanks

551
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,288
The fact that he had never met anybody

552
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:16,896
I might have been a reason for him to be more restrained in his executive orders right now

553
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:21,504
No because all he cares about is the defense of the United States

554
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:28,160
If there's any possibility of Japanese-Americans somehow cooperating with a Japanese invade

555
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,184
Asian forced

556
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,720
That he has to

557
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,280
Move the Japanese-Americans

558
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,864
What's this I'm sure that's all he would have thought

559
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,448
I mean I think it's all he did think

560
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,008
But what else could you have thought of

561
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,568
That's the only thing

562
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,104
He is going to focus

563
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,664
And if he doesn't he could be impeached

564
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,480
Or he could also

565
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:57,600
Worried about citizens right I think one of the look you're not you

566
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,904
You're missing the priorities

567
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,952
Is the priority is defense

568
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,048
That's the priority that's what these people are thinking about

569
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,864
You think they have time to be thinking about any

570
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:13,472
Any kind of nice ideas for protecting people

571
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
Any more than

572
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,568
Lincoln did

573
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:24,736
What he's referring to there is a moment in 1861 when Abraham Lincoln basically tossed this alleged Confederate

574
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,272
In jail without due process

575
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,600
Man Justified it by saying he had to save the Union

576
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,880
Nikes

577
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,952
Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney ruled against him

578
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:38,560
Cheerleaders at all well Tony he's the Chief Justice and he said this

579
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,608
Jerk should be released

580
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,936
I guess I have to do that he's the Chief Justice

581
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,496
No you do that enough time

582
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,800
As the president you're out

583
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,336
It seems to me that

584
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,384
That's why we have courts

585
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,736
We have all, that is not why we have

586
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,528
We do not have cords

587
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,600
So that presidents can be checked

588
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:05,696
Institchu ations of a national emergency

589
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,000
That was my cords were set up

590
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,936
Then what I mean

591
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,728
I'm flailing now but

592
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,776
Then what stops then what

593
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,104
If Congress can't stop them and if the courts can't stop them

594
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,432
Like what can stop a president in a time of War

595
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:30,784
There's nobody that nobody can check that that's the president's responsibility

596
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:42,304
Obviously I'd like a do-over because it somehow In the Heat of the Moment

597
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,584
I forgot

598
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,448
That I'm talking about defending the rights of actual American citizens

599
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,496
And Posner is talking about

600
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,776
People who are Rebel

601
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
Tube country

602
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,640
There's probably a way where I could have said

603
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
Pointed that out to him

604
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,504
Friends of the Court stepping in

605
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,808
I mean it happens it happens to Truman

606
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,856
But you know judge Posner is right

607
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,392
But it doesn't happen

608
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
A lot

609
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:12,256
Which is why he gets to be judge Posner and I'm the guy that had to check with a p

610
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,864
And by the way do you think these Supreme Court Justices

611
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,912
Are great big brains

612
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,704
Pink Stars

613
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:24,544
Who are selected because of the best lawyers in the United States

614
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,104
And their decisions are

615
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,896
Are usually great

616
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,176
You think you all that

617
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,272
I don't I don't have a high respect for the Supreme Court at all

618
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,464
You look at them

619
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,512
How they are appointed who appoints

620
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:51,936
This is so why do you think the Supreme Court has such a great balance to the

621
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,728
President

622
00:35:55,264 --> 00:36:01,408
This is what gets me up at

623
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,456
Get me going because

624
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,504
I still think it can be used as a present

625
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:09,600
So your ears you're still worried that it can be used

626
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
And that it

627
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,672
Do you think it will be like you don't like

628
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:19,072
You know I think we cannot take this for granted

629
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:31,872
Fred korematsu couldn't get Justice inside Supreme Court question is

630
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:38,272
Can you find it on the outside

631
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:44,672
More perfect will continue in a second

632
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:59,264
This is more perfect mchat I can ride here with Julie Longoria

633
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,312
All right so getting back to the story of Fred

634
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,896
Picking up from the decision what happened after that

635
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
So the

636
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:10,528
Internment camp where Fred was staying closed in 1945

637
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:15,648
And Fred have gotten permission by that point to work at a steel mill in Detroit

638
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,440
So he was living in Detroit

639
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,744
He fell in love with a woman named Katherine

640
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,840
They got married moved back to the Bay Area and had two kids

641
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:30,240
And Karen his daughter says that they were kind of ostracized from the Japanese American Community they grew up

642
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:34,336
Outside of the Japanese Community he was involved in Boy Scouts

643
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:39,968
Girl Scouts so I was a girl scout so we have the camps when we had to open the camp he would work on that

644
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,808
The Presbyterian Church in Oakland and then he became an elder

645
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:47,136
Even join the Lions Club and he was President twice

646
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,672
And Karen says throughout

647
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,696
The 40s

648
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,488
The 50s the 60s

649
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,328
She never heard him talk about his case no never

650
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,352
No never

651
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,632
Hit he just

652
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,424
Never

653
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,960
He never seen ever

654
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,240
Told the story

655
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,824
Even after she confronted him about it in high school yeah it's

656
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,592
That's it

657
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
But she says

658
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,432
In like 1969 ish

659
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,200
68 or 6

660
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,272
69 when the world was in a very different place

661
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:18,112
They got a phone call back in those days you know you my parents

662
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,648
Phone number was in the phone book

663
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,672
Of all things

664
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:23,232
Tell me my father we get phone calls from

665
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:28,096
Boston when it interview on but she really didn't want to talk about his case much he just

666
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:32,192
It was just too painful but this time there was a professor on the line

667
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,984
From the University of California Berkeley

668
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,312
It was a Japanese guy actually and he told Fred

669
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,872
I really really want you to come into my class

670
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,176
There was a ethnic studies

671
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:46,784
Class that was actually off-campus ethnic studies was not even recognize that

672
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,576
So he he talked

673
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:52,416
Yet at this ethnic studies class and these kids were brutal

674
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:59,328
Met UC Berkeley at that time had this in a notorious reputation of being very radical

675
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:05,728
People were asking questions during the whole hour this is Jean Quan former mayor of Oakland she was in the class that day

676
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:09,824
It was important times as you did as a different country like you have to learn up

677
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:15,200
Stand up to Authority and certainly these students were like DLC astounding saying well

678
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:21,088
Why didn't you why didn't you protest why didn't you do this why didn't you do that why didn't you fight harder

679
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,368
And we're almost

680
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,952
You're angry that we he wasn't angry I think

681
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:30,816
You got to remember that a lot of these students even know anything about the count

682
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:37,728
Many many kids had not had Frank discussions with their own Tara and so was korematsu me was probably a

683
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,752
Surrogate for light

684
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
Your parents

685
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,872
How could they have gone to that and never told me they had no right not

686
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
To tell me

687
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,432
And so they're really angry at their parents

688
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,968
Surrogate or not

689
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:54,880
Red felt like he was being indicted all over again it it was such a painful experience for my father he never

690
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,416
I want to speak to anyone again

691
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,984
Redwood ultimately challenge his conviction in a lower court

692
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,264
And you would win

693
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,592
The Supreme Court decision still stands

694
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,408
He was able to clear his own personal name

695
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,296
In around 1990

696
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,112
Again the world in a very different place

697
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,928
He finds himself again on a college campus

698
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,768
This time the University of Michigan

699
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,096
My father mother will Walking with some other students

700
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:41,984
Across campus to see the newly renovated library and

701
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:45,312
Beyond my father loved architecture was very old Gothic

702
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:49,408
Library so they're walking through the sort of open cloth

703
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,944
Looking at the architecture

704
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,504
And then they come upon this group of students

705
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,784
A group of

706
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Arab

707
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,088
American students

708
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,136
The students start walking toward in

709
00:40:59,392 --> 00:40:59,904
They

710
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,232
All of a sudden kind of surrounding my father and they had this

711
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,256
Certificate

712
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,560
To give to my father

713
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,352
To thank him for speaking up

714
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,264
So that was meaningful to him

715
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,384
Why why did that make you emotional

716
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,408
Why that story

717
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,880
Because it meant so much to my father

718
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:36,512
That this group really honored him

719
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,584
That also had been racially profiled

720
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:43,680
Y'all to think that he would be able to

721
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:50,080
Touch their lives it it kind of reinforced what

00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:56,479
What he was doing

723
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:00,063
Do you have the same faith in the Constitution that your dad did that.

724
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,343
Have

725
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,647
Great faith in our constitution

726
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,207
It is a great document

727
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,743
It

728
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:12,351
It so happens though that it's the way that certain people interpreted

729
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,911
That gets us into trouble

He wanted to Liberty V1 the people we are the people we the people

737
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:47,327
There are many many lawyers here they're all working pro bono today they're from different organization

738
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:53,727
What resistance looks like sends a message that they cannot do it

739
00:43:53,983 --> 00:44:00,127
The way with constitutional protections without people standing up for the Constitution so

740

Decision the majority on the court did

743
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,879
Port to overturn korematsu

744
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,671
Which is a big deal

745
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,487
They said it was wrong the day was decided

746
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,791
And that it has been overruled

747
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,327
In the court of History
