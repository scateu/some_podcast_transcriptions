00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Listener-supported WNYC

00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,424
Be Studios

3
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:12,032
Leadership support for more perfect is provided by the Joyce Foundation

4
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,080
This is more perfect

5
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,896
Serious about Supreme Court on Jedi boom rod

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,224
In February of 2017

7
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,040
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

8
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,600
Said something that surprised a lot of people

9
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,160
Well I would say that we are not

10
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,720
Experiencing the best of times

11
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:36,096
She stepped straight into the political Fray and addressed this political moment

12
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,632
It was a great man

13
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,936
A1 said

14
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,472
Netty

15
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:48,896
True symbol of the United States is not the bald eagle it is the pendulum

16
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:55,040
And when the pendulum swings too far in One Direction it will go back

17
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Some terrible things have happened in the United States but one can only hope

18
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
That we learn from those bad thing

19
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
Today we're going to ride the pendulum to the dark side I'm going to start with one of the most infamous decisions

20
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,800
Court has ever made

21
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,616
Korematsu decision

22
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
You might imagine it's not going to be the happiest of situations but the story that were going to tell you today

23
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,552
As far as well actually

24
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:34,208
They're not stories of bitterness as curious thing happens in both cases

25
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,536
Characters can't find Justice

26
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,328
Inside the Supreme Court

27
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,656
Stop looking for it there

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
Any find it somewhere else

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
Entirely

30
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,824
Producer Julia Longoria start this off

31
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:00,320
The year is 1967 and the place

32
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:06,720
Is San Lorenzo High School in East Bay of California

33
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,792
And we're in a US History classroom

34
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:16,192
I was actually a junior in high school this is Karen korematsu I'm the executive

35
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:22,080
Director and founder of the Fred T korematsu Institute in San Francisco so on this particular day

36
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:27,456
Karen is sitting at the back of the classroom and our teacher had assigned each of

37
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:34,368
My classmates a little paperback book to read you know books about American history government in the US

38
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
Assignment was to

39
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:42,048
Then I get up in front of the class and give an oral book report to me this is a long time ago so that's the way they used to do

40
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:48,448
Do things I don't even remember what my my book was are my subject but Karen said she was just sitting there and Claw

41
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
Class listening as

42
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,776
One by one her classmates got up

43
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:57,152
Talk about George Washington or Abraham Lincoln or whatever and then my friend

44
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:03,552
Maya who is Japanese-American 3rd Generation like myself got up in front of the class

45
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
And

46
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,392
Her book was called concentration camps USA

47
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,232
About the Japanese-American internment

48
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,792
And I thought

49
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
No that's

50
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
Interesting I

51
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,144
Hadn't heard about that before

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,424
What's that about

53
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,728
My book report went something like this

54
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:28,128
In 1941 the United States of America was attacked

55
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,432
The president's president

56
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:36,832
Roosevelt had to respond

57
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
Broadbent

58
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,392
So in terms of Defense

59
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:45,280
One of the big questions for Roosevelt was what happens if the Japanese invade the continental US

60
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,864
America's founding

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,168
It probably come in on the West Coast

62
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,032
And you had more than a hundred thousand Japanese-Americans living on the West Coast

63
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,592
Like what they turn against the United States

64
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
They didn't know

65
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,528
And so her friend my explained to the class on February 19th 1942

66
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,344
Roosevelt issued executive order 90066

67
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,696
That gave the military the authority

68
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:20,095
To forcibly remove anyone of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast

69
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:25,215
She goes on to explain these the horrific circumstances and

70
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
How

71
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:32,383
120000 people of Japanese ancestry had been real forcibly removed from their home

72
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
She explained they were put into these

73
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,855
Detention camps really without any due process of law but then she went on to say but there was this one

74
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Unmanned

75
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,439
Who refused to go to the camps

76
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:51,839
And he was arrested and he sue the government and took his case all the way to the Supreme Court

77
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,631
And then he became a landmark

78
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,655
Supreme Court case

79
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,191
And that man's name

80
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
Is Fred korematsu

81
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
Oh

82
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,567
I said to myself

83
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,359
That's my name

84
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,711
She says the class got really quiet

85
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
And I had

86
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,295
35 pairs of eyes

87
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,831
Turn around looking at me

88
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
Okay yes

89
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:18,463
She. My last name is korematsu my dad's name is Fred but no way

90
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,535
There's no way it's my dad someone would have told me

91
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
So

92
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
Corson I go running home and

93
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,679
Confronting my mother and asking her

94
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,959
What she say

95
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,543
Well I got the standard to answer

96
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,871
Wait till your father gets home and you can ask him

97
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,967
The Voice you heard by the way was Elie mystal our legal editor and by the time he

98
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,367
I got home it was 8 in the evening and so that's a long time after you know 3:30 in the afternoon

99
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:50,207
And I calm down a little bit and I asked him in and he said

100
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,535
It happened a long time ago

101
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,095
And what he did he thought was right

102
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,887
And the government was wrong

103
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
And it was at clear and simple

104
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
I could just see

105
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,383
This hurt going over his face and I just couldn't ask him

106
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
Any more questions

107
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,295
Karen says it wasn't until years later that she learned what really happened

108
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,343
And why her dad never wanted to talk about

109
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
Well

110
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,767
I was 21 then

111
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:30,143
This is fred korematsu at stapleton from the densho archives

112
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,191
And I was up on the hill

113
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
Sunday morning

114
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,287
My girlfriend from Fred story starts

115
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:41,663
Out on a date when you're that age you know you have a girlfriend just like anybody else

116
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,503
And she was more important to me than anything

117
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,903
Fred and his girlfriend Ida are driving in the Hills above San Francisco looking down on the city the Golden Gate

118
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,999
Bridge you've been dating this girl for a while now

119
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
Italian-American

120
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,607
Both of his friends were Caucasian we were in a car

121
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,935
And we were deciding what to do with such a nice day

122
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
If It Go picnicking or something like that

123
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:11,103
And then all sudden I heard

124
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,711
Japanese

125
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:20,319
Pokemon are newer car radio

126
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,415
Cloud right now

127
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,767
And I was quite shocked we both were

128
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,631
Fred knew there was a war on and that the US was likely to get involved

129
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:39,519
Even try to enlist in the US military but was denied because he was Japanese-American

130
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,079
Pizza City near one of his first thoughts was

131
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,407
Why does it have to be Japan

132
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,967
Some country was going to attack Pearl Harbor

133
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,247
I wish it was Russia

134
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
You know

135
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,319
I just thought about that you know

136
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,903
I was bitter with the pan fry having this happen

137
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,231
So I took her home

138
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,511
And then I went home

139
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
So

140
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,399
He gets home

141
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
Paintball shot

142
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,007
They're all sitting around the living room

143
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287
The house is

144
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:18,175
Just in the spare his mom is in tears they were proud of being Japanese you know

145
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,711
They obey the law

146
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,271
They did everything that supposed to mean

147
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
To have this happen

148
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,855
I put them in chain

149
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,183
It was even hard to talk to them after that

150
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:35,327
Fred had a traditional immigrant Japanese-American families

151
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,727
His parents were born in Japan and then all his brothers were born here in the US born in Oakland California

152
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:46,079
He was the third out of four brothers and being the Third

153
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615
At the 2nd to the 1st

154
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,919
That mattered absolutely

155
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:54,783
Fred was anemic position as the third son he could resist

156
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:59,903
We asked laraine b'nai I teach at Seattle University School of Law for some contacts

157
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,303
Kiawah professor and a friend of Fred's family the cultural tradition is that the first son is the favorite son

158
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:12,959
The oldest was going to inherit the family garden and Nursery business II would help out with that business friend

159
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,983
As a third

160
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,543
Sunbiz very low on the totem pole

161
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,407
His parents and have the same expectations of him relatively speaking he was kind of the hook

162
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:28,575
Unlike his older brothers he didn't speak much Japanese and he felt more American than anything else

163
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:34,719
When I was in school we started each day for the Pledge of Allegiance I studied American history

164
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,279
I always been a good American citizen

165
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,351
So when he came home that Sunday when Pearl Harbor was attacked

166
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,167
Is family's response to the whole thing was

167
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
Unsettling

168
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
I am

169
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
I didn't know what to do

170
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,079
And Fred says pretty soon after

171
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
Things got very weird

172
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,967
Within a few days I put spotlights on the whole Nursery at night

173
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,527
And they had a guard standing right now

174
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,855
Our home there around the fence there watching us

175
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:06,719
Cuz I went out one night to have a cigarette and I was saying on the parts and I got a cigarette

176
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,071
And I guarantee a lot if I was singling somebody

177
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,119
Ridiculous

178
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
Then came Roosevelt executive order

179
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
That big order 906 6

180
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,895
Authorized the military to make a series of smaller ones

181
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,943
The first set of orders was a curfew order

182
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:31,295
Saying that Japanese Italians and Germans were subject to a curfew

183
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:36,159
Second order was a freeze order directed just at the Japanese on the West Coast

184
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:41,791
They weren't allowed to leave the area and then the third order wasn't ordered that they could not

185
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
We met

186
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
On the West Coast

187
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:51,007
Except for in the custody of an approved location by the army

188
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,615
They're about 15 of these assembly centers

189
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:02,015
Japanese-Americans were told to report to one of these centers by a certain date

190
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:07,135
Brett's family began to scramble they had to worry about what they were going to take

191
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,535
What was going to happen to the nursery and still expecting my mother you know the attention and

192
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,863
Worries so in the days before his family left

193
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:22,239
Fred made a decision

194
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:28,895
I am I had my own worries and I had my own girlfriend my own problem decided not to go with his fan

195
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
I am

196
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,711
Talk to them bedtime

197
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
That I can want to

198
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
I won't leave with you

199
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
You didn't want to leave item behind

200
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,719
I thought maybe the two of them could make a break for it later on

201
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Leave the state

202
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
Before the evacuation deadline

203
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
And

204
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,911
They said fine if you can do it

205
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
Go ahead

206
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,263
She was the third son

207
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:01,919
So he knew that his older brothers would be able to take care of the family and they said he was

208
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,479
Was a grown-up and he should make his own decisions

209
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:09,087
And so he did he went off and got his own apartment and its own job as a welder

210
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,391
I'm kind of lived under the radar

211
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,791
News brothers would be there to take care of his parents if you're with the family

212
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,607
Like my family or any Japanese family

213
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,191
You feel the pressure in the

214
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
Sadness

215
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,615
But on the outside is different just like a normal

216
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
What if you know

217
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,455
Just like we've been living all the time

218
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
I felt right at home

219
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,391
You know I'm an American citizen to you know

220
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
I didn't feel guilty

221
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,559
Cuz I don't think I did anything wrong

222
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:56,191
You sense that he was politically aware at this point

223
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,751
If you're asking me about whether he

224
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,079
Refuse to go as an act of political resistance

225
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,615
I don't think initially

226
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,431
Unconsciously he probably

227
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,015
New that what was happening to Japanese-Americans was wrong

228
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,367
But I don't think he had the words for that we might have today

229
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:21,279
Is on his way home from work one day that he reads in the newspaper

230
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:26,143
Paper about his parents and all the other Japanese-Americans in the area being taken away to camp

231
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,543
Baby's sick to my stomach and on that I can see my parents going in you.

232
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
My brothers

233
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:38,175
Going to camp and I'm not there you know

234
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:44,575
But that was only time that I felt kind of

235
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:50,975
Lonely you know like what what am I going to do now you know

236
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,327
It begins to slowly down on him what he's done

237
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,679
By staying in the Bay Area he is officially breaking the law

238
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:05,055
And he and Ida aren't sure what that means like will they be thrown in jail or worse

239
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,615
He talks in the archives about how he's worried

240
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
And I was worried to

241
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,223
Because now he could get arrested

242
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
So they start to think about their options

243
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:19,903
Fred decides to get an ID with a Spanish sounding last name on it so we won't be recognized the Japanese

244
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,183
And then

245
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
Ida says

246
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,255
Essentially that might not be enough

247
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:28,095
She pulled out an article regarding plastic surgery

248
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
And

249
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
What do you think of this

250
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,287
I looked it over and well

251
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
I didn't

252
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,919
Baker was a good idea but she said hey why don't you think about

253
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:46,527
That's this might be a good thing that will allow you to stay here

254
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,343
So the idea would be that he

255
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:55,743
You don't have his eyes doubled or something like that a plastic surgery procedure where you put a fold in the III

256
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
Gilead

257
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
So you look more white less

258
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:01,119
Japanese American

259
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,935
And I guess I don't know

260
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
Well

261
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,079
She said she'll be looking to it

262
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
And

263
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:19,295
Nothing to lose so we decide to try it

264
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:24,927
So Fred gets into his car and he drives into the city into San Francisco and he

265
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,255
Just stops in front of the doctor's office

266
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,863
How do you start spacing

267
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,959
Walking up the steps of this Victorian and then

268
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:42,847
Walking down the steps to leave and he was a really crummy idea and then walking back up the steps

269
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:47,711
Thinking well yeah maybe I just right it's a good idea on the down the steps

270
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,271
This is a ridiculous idea

271
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:54,111
Giving some doctor your hard-earned money to

272
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,671
Change your face

273
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,695
Photos app

274
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
And down

275
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,999
And I

276
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279
I'm down

277
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
And I

278
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,095
Down until

279
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,655
He decided to just

280
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
Going

281
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,983
And have the procedure done

282
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,287
He really did it as a way to

283
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,103
Protect them as they try to leave the state

284
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:21,759
The doctor said he was going to work on his eyes and then also fix a broken nose I had a broken nose

285
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,319
I'm playing football and I never had it fixed

286
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
And

287
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,159
So you could do pretty good work on me

288
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,743
But it turned out he didn't do everything he said he would

289
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
Regis

290
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,071
Took my money that's what it was I join

291
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,631
There wasn't anything change except

292
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,447
I didn't have a broken nose anymore

293
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,591
So he drives back to the East Bay with a new nose but the same eyes

294
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:51,711
And shortly after that day at the doctor's office he's out buying cigarettes at a convenience store

295
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,759
Leclerc

296
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,599
Recognized him and reported him

297
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:02,207
And one day walking down the street he was stopped

298
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
And arrest

299
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
And

300
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,935
Spent his Memorial Day and 1942 in the San Leandro jail

301
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,495
When we got caught

302
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,799
They called her into

303
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
Yeah

304
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
And

305
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,967
I see the police chief

306
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,015
Talking to her for quite a while

307
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:34,719
I imagine it's a small jail and he's just been admitted so he's sitting in the lobby and he sees I to come into the front.

308
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,607
He's just out of earshot can't make out exactly what they're saying but at a certain point

309
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,143
They stop talking

310
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
She just walks out

311
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
So

312
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
That was the end of it

313
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,079
I never did see her again

314
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:05,183
They never saw each other

315
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,423
So he sitting there alone in the Stanley

316
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,055
AndroGel and they end up transferring him to Oakland jail for some reason and then he ends up at

317
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:25,919
The federal prison in San Francisco because resisting the order was a federal offense

318
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,455
Anyway

319
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,831
One day I got a call from the guard

320
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:39,487
And told me I had a visitor and I didn't know it was you know

321
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:45,887
I knew all my friends were in can't or they were in the military but that goes down to the visiting room anyway

322
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:50,751
And there's assman there

323
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,335
Well I believe in civil liberties

324
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,663
Right of people is being denied

325
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,063
This is something that i'm concerned about the man says his name is ernest besig

326
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
Easier to talk to me

327
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,719
He asked if I need some cigarettes or something like that you know

328
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,791
Just to break the ice

329
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,095
By the way I asked him

330
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,143
Who you represent

331
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,191
And Earnest response well

332
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:27,359
ACLU or something like that

333
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:33,759
We have no way of knowing what exactly was said between Fred and Ernest besig

334
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,807
Both men have passed away

335
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,671
But it seems like something important must have happened in this conversation because

336
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:46,815
If I was Lori Benitez I don't think he had the words for that we might have today Fred

337
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
Didn't have

338
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,887
The language of resistance

339
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
Before this moment

340
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,983
Something in that conversation must have

341
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,007
Giving it to him

342
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,567
Because when Earnest basich asked him

343
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,895
Do you want me to represent you in a court of law

344
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,687
Fred says yes

345
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,295
What do you imagine the words worth it

346
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,111
Might have turned him in that moment

347
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,671
Imagine

348
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
That

349
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,743
Basic must have said to fraud

350
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,583
We think that was happened to Japanese Americans

351
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,631
Is unconstitutional

352
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,215
We'd like to bring a lawsuit to say the Japanese Americans

353
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,007
Are being sent away

354
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,543
Only because of their race

355
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,591
And in that

356
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,919
Gay pride language

357
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:41,343
But what I think Fred knew was wrong

358
00:20:54,399 --> 00:21:00,543
Basic try to get Fred out of jail but the military stepped in and said he had

359
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,335
How to join his family and camp

360
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,175
They were at a place called Tanforan race tracks

361
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,991
It was a temporary holding spot

362
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:13,855
So that meant that the first place that Fred went after jail was

363
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:21,280
A converted horse stall and there's holes on the walls

364
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,840
Just blew internal that's blue in there and everything

365
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,680
And this was a small horse dog because bread ask for his own

366
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:32,288
Wanted to sit and think about what to say to his family to were also at

367
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
Tanforan

368
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:39,712
Satin V single lone bear light bulb above and the smell of manure

369
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:43,808
Hey I mean it's ready for horses not for human beings

370
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,256
And then all sudden I hear a knock on the door

371
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,072
And I opening with my brother

372
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,120
Say you can't stay here you

373
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
You got coming

374
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
Cedar Park

375
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:08,640
We walk spread over to the Star Wars families been living

376
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:14,016
And I was surprised the way they fixed up their stall

377
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
They

378
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,856
Solar panel cracks

379
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:23,232
And they put newspaper for the walls in the paper that all up

380
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,560
This was a common thing for these families

381
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:31,680
Thousands of them were transferred to more permanent camps and many stay there for up to 3 years

382
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,728
Overtime

383
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,032
The community

384
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,616
Kind of tried to build lives for themselves

385
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,432
If your stories and see pictures

386
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,272
People building small Japanese gardens

387
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,600
What they found in the area

388
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:54,464
She saw newsreels about the people who made the Desert Bloom

389
00:22:55,744 --> 00:23:01,120
Eventually saw people

390
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,680
Forming you know baseball teams

391
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:33,888
My brother he was involved in various Japanese activities

392
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,192
And

393
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,776
He thought it might be a good idea for me to

394
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,896
Get some suggestions and opinions regarding to

395
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,480
If I should fight the case or not

396
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,832
So Fred's brother calls a meeting

397
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,648
You got about 30 young people together

398
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,464
Imagine it was f****** a mess hall or something like that

399
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,768
And they discussed Frets case

400
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,792
They were

401
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:05,120
Discussion is to themselves or in little groups

402
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:10,496
And I stood around and waited for someone to speak

403
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,128
But no one actually came out to speak to me

404
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:33,792
I can see Fred kind of standing in a corner as people are gathered in small groups

405
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,096
Whispering to each other

406
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,912
Stealing glances at him

407
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:54,016
But no one says a word to him

408
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:02,976
Finding one dead and you said Fred were undecided on

409
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
If I should find

410
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
Acacia not because

411
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,584
They don't want to

412
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,656
Make any more disturbance

413
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,728
Anything to upset

414
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,544
The parents right at the time because they were

415
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,872
To upset already and think just being in Camp

416
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,432
They told him their parents have been through enough

417
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,224
Leaving their lives behind

418
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,040
Basically they said

419
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
We can't help you

420
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:39,328
But there was one Japanese American group that did decide to say something about Fred's case

421
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
What's the name of the group

422
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,912
Jacl

423
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,240
Ernest bacak had a nickname for this group

424
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,288
The Japanese-American Citizens League

425
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,824
The jackals

426
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
I meant

427
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,176
With a leadership of that group

428
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
Several of them

429
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
I purged them

430
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,528
To oppose

431
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,808
The explosion

432
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,904
But they didn't seem to be particularly interested

433
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,720
The JCL condemned Frets case

434
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,280
And anyone else who fought against the government orders

435
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:13,632
Said it would not support any of these individuals were fighting the orders

436
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,168
And called them

437
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,448
Self-styled martyrs

438
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,264
Wow they use that phrase

439
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,848
They would basically get everyone else into trouble

440
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,176
To do this by myself

441
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,480
I just wonder if I was doing wrong or

442
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,296
Or maybe putting them in Shame by

443
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,344
I'm bringing the issue up again

444
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:41,792
Because of Japanese people lay their peaceful people when they they like to leave things alone if they can

445
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:47,168
Because they were in enough trouble as it is because of this Pearl Harbor attack

446
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,728
And the country blame them

447
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,800
So they have the sort of a guilty complex

448
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,104
Even though

449
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,896
They have nothing to do with it

450
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:04,832
Majority I'm just avoided me so therefore I assume that

451
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,232
That

452
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,560
I got myself in this problem

453
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
And

454
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,448
That was my problem than that and not theirs

455
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:29,408
Fred continue to fight his case he argued that basically rounding up

456
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:35,808
Thousands of Japanese-Americans American citizens without a trial without due process

457
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:40,416
Basically amounted to racial discrimination

458
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,584
Is case made its way up and down the courts and eventually two-and-a-half years after he met

459
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,376
Pattern spastic in that jail cell

460
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,168
The case arrives

461
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,960
At the Supreme Court

462
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:57,056
Yo he said he thought that by the time his case got to the Supreme Court

463
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,616
Bedspreads daughter Karen again he would

464
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:03,456
Be able to vindicate his family and everyone that had been incarcerated

465
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,016
And that's how much he believed in the Supreme Court

466
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,136
And so when that didn't happen he felt like

467
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,208
If he felt like it was his fault

468
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,792
That's a big bird to carry around

469
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,888
What ends up happening is

470
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,704
On December 18th 1944

471
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,984
The Supreme Court

472
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,520
Rules against Fred

473
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,056
It's kind of a

474
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,848
Complicated decision

475
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,872
Supreme Court

476
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
Said

477
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,176
Racial distinctions

478
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,224
When the government is making racial

479
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,064
Distinction it's serious when you look at this very very carefully

480
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,624
And that was a big president

481
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,904
Sun a lot of ways

482
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
It's

483
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,952
Kind of

484
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:49,280
Victory for people fighting racial discrimination

485
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,584
But then the court turned around and said

486
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:55,168
Even though racial distinctions are serious

487
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,448
This one

488
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
Is not

489
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
Strictly racial

490
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,848
We are at war with the Japanese empire there for

491
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,408
Rounding up Japanese-American Citizens

492
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
Is a way to

493
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,480
Defend the nation

494
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,600
How's your friend at this point

495
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:17,440
Like it sounds like it sounds like lonely and then I can almost imagine because you're

496
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
Your

497
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,232
By yourself

498
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,024
Pretty-much on all fronts

499
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:27,168
The country that you feel so a part of that you want to actually enlist in the military to fight for

500
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,216
Doesn't seem to want you that moment

501
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,520
Your own Community doesn't seem to want you

502
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
Your family

503
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,592
Is a Shame by you

504
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
Your girlfriend

505
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,920
Is gone

506
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,760
I can't imagine being more alone at this point

507
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,320
Any never shared that with my brother I

508
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,208
He shared it with my mother but but we didn't that wasn't part of our dinner conversation

509
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,472
From Muslim

510
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,784
You know

511
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:25,024
What is speed

512
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,632
This is the crazy thing about the korematsu decision

513
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,400
It is

514
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,936
Still on the books

515
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,544
That guy Carl Higbie got on Megyn Kelly and

516
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,568
Said this

517
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:41,920
Stuff about korematsu in the very next day he got on and apologize for saying that

518
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,200
But he's right

519
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,272
Korematsu is technically still good law

520
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,064
Justice Antonin Scalia

521
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,088
One said

522
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,904
That sherp korematsu was wrongly decided

523
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,720
But if you think that it's not going to happen again

524
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,256
You're kidding yourself

525
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,584
Do the cord isn't going to get across the president

526
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,376
An international marriage

527
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,240
Would you like us to

528
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,288
I think so

529
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,592
You would you like it

530
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
No

531
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,712
That's not injured in school yet it's a judge named Richard Posner

532
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,808
Not the time that we talked to him he was on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals

533
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,856
He was widely considered by

534
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:26,464
People on both the left and the right to be one of the most influential judges in the country

535
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,024
He sometimes called the 10th Supreme Court Justice

536
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:33,376
And he's a big defender of the korematsu decision

537
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:38,752
What do you say then to Fred korematsu what do you say then to to a Japanese-American about

538
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,544
Kind of the law and the courts

539
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,104
Well they were given compensation

540
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,200
Right I mean Thursday

541
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:53,088
There is no pain suffering there is there there's an anguish right that we can

542
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,624
Exactly commodify

543
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,440
Yeah but

544
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,256
At the time it all happened

545
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,816
Shortly after Pearl Harbor

546
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:07,936
It seemed like the right thing to do and probably was the right thing to

547
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,704
To go

548
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
And I imagine that

549
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,032
The officials and

550
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,104
Federal government in

551
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,640
1941

552
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:21,760
They probably didn't know anything about Japanese-Americans on the West Coast

553
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:26,112
Roosevelt never committed Japanese-American I doubt it

554
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:26,880
Like I just

555
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:27,904
Think that meow

556
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:31,488
The fact that he had never met anybody

557
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:36,096
I might have been a reason for him to be more restrained in his executive orders right now

558
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:39,168
No because all he cares about is

559
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,704
Defense of the United States

560
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:47,360
If there's any possibility of Japanese-Americans somehow cooperating with a Japanese invade

561
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,384
Asian forced

562
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,920
That he has to

563
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,480
Move the Japanese-Americans

564
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:56,064
What's this I'm sure that's all he would have thought

565
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,904
I think it's all he did think of

566
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,208
But what else could have thought of

567
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,768
That's the only thing

568
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,304
He is going to focus

569
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,864
And if he doesn't he could be impeached

570
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:16,800
Or he could also worried about citizens right now I think one of the look you're not you

571
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,104
You're missing the priorities

572
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,640
Is the priority is to

573
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
Fence

574
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:25,248
That's the priority that's what these people are thinking about

575
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,064
You think they have time to be thinking about any

576
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:32,672
Any kind of nice ideas for protecting people

577
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,952
Any more than

578
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,768
Lincoln did

579
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:43,936
What he's referring to there is a moment in 1861 when Abraham Lincoln basically tossed this alleged Confederate

580
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,472
In jail without due process

581
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,800
And then Justified it by saying he had to save the Union

582
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,080
Nikes

583
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,152
Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney ruled against him

584
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:57,760
Cheerleaders at all well Tony he's the Chief Justice and he said this

585
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,808
Jerk should be released

586
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,136
I guess I have to do that he's the Chief Justice

587
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,696
No you do that enough time

588
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,000
As the president you're out

589
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,536
It seems to me that

590
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,584
That's why we have courts

591
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,936
We help, we have

592
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,728
We do not have cords

593
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,800
So that presidents can be checked

594
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:24,896
Institutions of a national emergency

595
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,200
That was my cords were set up

596
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,392
Then what I mean

597
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,928
I'm flailing now but

598
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,976
Then what stops then what

599
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:42,304
If Congress can't stop them and if the courts can't stop him

600
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,632
Like what can stop a president in a time of War

601
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:49,472
There's nobody that nobody can check that that's the president's response

602
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
Stillwater

603
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
Obviously I'd like a do-over

604
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,504
Because somehow In the Heat of the Moment

605
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,784
I forgot

606
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
That

607
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:07,648
I'm talking about defending the rights of actual American citizen

608
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,696
And Posner is talking about

609
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,976
People who are Rebels

610
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
To the country

611
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,840
There is probably a way where I could have said

612
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,376
Pointed that out to him

613
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,704
Friends of the Court definition

614
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,008
I mean it happens it happens to Truman

615
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,056
But you know her is right

616
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,592
But it doesn't happen

617
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
A lot

618
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:31,456
Which is why he gets to be judge Posner and I'm the guy that had to check with a p

619
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:36,064
And by the way do you think these Supreme Court Justices

620
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,112
Are great big brains

621
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,904
Pink Stars

622
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,744
Who are selected because of the best lawyers in the United States

623
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,304
And their decisions are

624
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,376
Are usually great you think of all that

625
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,472
I don't I don't have a high respect for the Supreme Court at all

626
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,664
You look at them

627
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,712
How they are appointed who appoints

628
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:11,392
This is so why do you think the Supreme Court has such a great balance to the

629
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,928
President

630
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:20,608
This is what gets me up

631
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,656
Get me going because

632
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,704
I still think it can be used at the Press

633
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,800
So you're you're you're still worried that it can be used

634
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
And that it

635
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,872
Do you think it will be like you don't like

636
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:35,200
You know I think we cannot take this for granted

637
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:48,000
Since Fred korematsu couldn't get Justice inside spring

638
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:54,400
Question is can you find it on the outside

639
00:36:54,656 --> 00:37:00,800
Perfect will continue in a second

640
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:19,744
More perfect I'm Jedi vim Rod here with Julie Longoria

641
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,536
All right so getting back to the story of Fred

642
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:28,448
Picking up from the decision what happened after that so the internment camp where Fred was staying

643
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,752
Closed in 1945

644
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,288
And

645
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,592
Fred has gotten permission by that point to work

646
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,128
At a steel mill in Detroit

647
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,968
So he was living in Detroit he fell in love with a woman named Katherine

648
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
They

649
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,320
Got married moved back to the Bay Area and had two kids

650
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,600
And

651
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:50,720
Karen his daughter says that they were kind of ostracized from the Japanese American Community they grew up

652
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:54,816
Outside of the Japanese Community he was involved in Boy Scouts

653
00:37:55,072 --> 00:38:00,448
Girl Scouts so I was a girl scout so we have the camps when we had to open the camp he would work on that

654
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:04,032
The Presbyterian Church in Oakland and then he became an elder

655
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:07,360
Even join the Lions Club and he was President twice

656
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,896
And Karen says throughout

657
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,176
The 40s

658
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,968
The fifties the 60s

659
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,784
She never heard him talk about his case

660
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,808
No never

661
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832
Now or Never

662
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,112
Hit he just

663
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
Never

664
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,440
He never seen ever

665
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,464
Told the story

666
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,072
Even after she confronted him about it in high school yeah it's that's it

667
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:30,912
But she says in like 1969 ish

668
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:34,496
68 or 69 when the world was in a very different place

669
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:38,592
They got a phone call back in those days you know you my parents

670
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,128
Phone number was in the phone book

671
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,152
Of all things

672
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,944
Tell me my father we get phone calls

673
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,064
From law student when the interview on but he really didn't want to talk about his case much

674
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,832
She just

675
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:54,464
It was just too painful but this time there was a professor on the line from the University of California Berkeley

676
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,536
It was a Japanese guy actually and he told Fred

677
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:04,192
I really really want you to come into my class there are was a ethnic studies class that was actually off

678
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
Off campus

679
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,264
Ethnic studies was not even recognize that

680
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,056
So he he talked

681
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,640
Yet at this ethnic studies class and these kids were brutal

682
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,968
Me UC Berkeley at that time had the snow

683
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,248
Notorious

684
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:22,112
Reputation of being very radical for asking questions during the whole hour

685
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:28,512
This is Jean Quan former mayor of Oakland she was in the class that day and it was important

686
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:34,912
Different country like you have to learn up stand up to Authority and certainly these students were like DLC astounding say

687
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,448
Well why didn't you

688
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,776
Why didn't you protest why didn't you do this why didn't you do that

689
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,800
Why didn't you fight

690
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,592
Harder and we're almost

691
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:46,176
You're angry that we he wasn't angry I think

692
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:51,296
You got to remember that a lot of these students even know anything about the counts

693
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:56,160
Many many kids had not had Frank discussions with her own Tara and so

694
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,976
Was korematsu it was probably a surrogate for like

695
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,256
Your parents

696
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,864
How could they have gone to that and never told me they had no right not to tell me

697
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,912
And so they're really angry at their parents

698
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,448
Surrogate or not

699
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:15,360
Red felt like he was being indicted all over again it it was such a painful experience for my father he never want

700
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,640
How to speak to anyone again

701
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:30,464
Fred would ultimately challenge his conviction in a lower court

702
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,744
And you would win

703
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:35,072
The Supreme Court decision still stands

704
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,888
He was able to clear his own personal name

705
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,520
Around 1990

706
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,336
Again the world in a very different place

707
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,408
He finds himself again on a college campus

708
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:52,992
This time the University of Michigan

709
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,320
My father mother will Walking with some other students

710
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,368
Across campus

711
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:02,464
To see the newly renovated library and

712
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,792
Beyond my father loved architecture was very old Gothic

713
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:11,168
Library so they're walking through this sort of open cloth looking at the architecture

714
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,984
And then they come upon this group of students

715
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,264
A group of

716
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,032
Arab

717
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,568
American students

718
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,128
The students start walking toward in they

719
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:23,456
All of a sudden kind of surrounding my father and they had this

720
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,736
Certificate

721
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,784
To give to my father

722
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,832
To thank him for speaking up

723
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,488
So that was meaningful to him

724
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,864
Why why did that make you emotional

725
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,888
Why that story

726
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,752
Well

727
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,104
Because it meant so much to my father

728
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:56,735
That this group really honored him

729
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
That

730
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,807
Also had been racially profiled

731
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:03,903
Y'all to think that he would be able to

732
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:10,303
Touch their lives it it kind of reinforced

733
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:16,703
What he was doing

734
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,775
Do you have the same faith in the Constitution that your dad did that yet

735
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:23,871
Have great faith in our constitution

736
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,431
It is a great document

737
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,967
It

738
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:32,831
It so happens though that it's the way that certain people interpret it

739
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,135
That gets us into trouble

740
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,671
Yes

741
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,207

We want to deliver TV1 the people we are the people

749
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:10,623
There are many many lawyers here they're all working pro bono today they're from different organization

750
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:17,023
What resistance looks like sends a message that they cannot do

751
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:23,423
Go away with constitutional protections without people standing up for the Constitution so

752
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:29,823
I think this is inspirational I think it's wonderful and I think we need to be vigilant and keep fighting

753
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:40,223
