1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:00,768
Play this is jazz

2
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,840
So more perfect season 2 is

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,632
Nearing to a close

4
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:07,424
You got this episode you're going to hear

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,960
One big one app

6
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:11,264
Holidays and then we're basically done

7
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,800
Start to think about season 3

8
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,640
Can actually want to ask for your help as we look forward

9
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,408
Baidu

10
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,712
More perfect

11
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,992
Is an

12
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:25,600
Nitro's organically out of Radiolab we were doing these stories about

13
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,368
Law

14
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,904
You know like 60 words

15
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,696
We're like to do more of that

16
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,720
So we did

17
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,048
Ultimately we created the space where

18
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,376
The idea was could we take these

19
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,448
Massive topics like guns

20
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,472
Gerrymander

21
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:45,312
Affirmative action just to name a few from the season

22
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,384
Recover them in a way that was still kind of

23
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
Human

24
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,224
Surprising

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,992
Cinematic

26
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,576
We had this amazing team

27
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:57,600
Borders

28
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,624
Fact checkers

29
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,904
Researchers

30
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,928
Mosers

31
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:07,328
To make this series and here we are thinking about season 3

32
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:12,960
I need to ask for your help

33
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,544
In order for there to be a season 3 and Beyond

34
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:20,896
We need some folks to step forward right now and help us pay for the cost

35
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,456
Of making another season of more perfect

36
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
Radiolab do this but if you are new to this it's really no mystery it cost money to make this

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,392
Series

38
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,952
Taipei the incredible team that we've hired

39
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488
To get them on planes

40
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
Make sure they have equipment

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,096
Payroll Studio cost the band with all of it cost money

42
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,120
This

43
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,424
Is a deeply reported highly produced

44
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
Situation

45
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,568
It's not just two dudes in a studio

46
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,480
So here's the simple pitch 75 bucks

47
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
Can you do it

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,320
75 bucks

Okay ready this is more perfect ride here with Julia Longoria

66
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
Hello hello Julia

67
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:05,760
Hi so we've been getting this question

68
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,856
From listeners and it's something I've always wondered

69
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
To listening to the

70
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,952
To the song we just heard the Oye Oye

71
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
Who is that man

72
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,839
Who's singing so like soulfully and rhythmically

73
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
And

74
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
We

75
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
We look

76
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,519
I understand that in your retirement you might be doing some

77
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
Dancing

78
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,311
I dance now

79
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,591
Least

80
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
Once a week

81
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,151
Fussbot 3 hours

82
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,991
Alfred Wong Marshall the Supreme Court from 1976

83
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
1990

84
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
Before

85
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,087
He's a New Yorker son of Chinese immigrants

86
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,415
He earned a bronze star medal in World War II

87
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
And worked in the White House

88
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
And

89
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,255
Beloved

90
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,791
To dance what style

91
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,399
Where are you

92
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,447
Watch other people dancing

93
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,751
Steal some of their steps

94
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,919
I understand. Even given a lesson or two at the court

95
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:13,599
Apparently he thought some Supreme Court staff how to ballroom dance

96
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
What does bidding

97
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,695
Because as the Marshal of the Supreme Court

98
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
Part of his job

99
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,535
If you keep time on the time keeper

100
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,351
Oral argument at the Supreme Court is a bit like a dance

101
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
Each side generally gets

102
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
1/2 hour

103
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959
When lawyer starts It Off

104
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:33,311
As soon as he starts to argue or she

105
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,103
It's a countdown clock

106
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,407
That first lawyer presents to the 9s

107
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
And the justices

108
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
Kind of lead

109
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,759
They interrupt

110
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,783
Acting Quest

111
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,599
When it gets down to about 5 minutes

112
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
Atraso squid

113
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,439
A white light appears on Electra

114
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,487
When the first floor finishes

115
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
The other lawyer gets

116
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,047
Return same thing

117
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,607
Represent justices ask questions

118
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
Batiste lawyer only gets

119
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
30 minutes

120
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
Now

121
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
That is the

122
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,031
Nightmare former

123
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,591
For many many attorneys login

124
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,895
When they run out of time

125
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
Put the red light

126
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
No excuses

127
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
You have to stop

128
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,343
Okay well that's a mystery solved

129
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,647
So the thing I want to talk about today is

130
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,719
The dance that Alfred Wang presided over

131
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,255
Sometimes

132
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
It gets

133
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
A little

134
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
Dicey

135
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
Okay so I

136
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,423
Was working on her episode about Ruth Bader Ginsburg

137
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,775
By the way is called sex it feels too few EPS back definitely take a listen

138
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,103
And I was listening to an oral argument after oral argument

139
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,407
After oral argument and I noticed something

140
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,967
I kind of sent me down this rabbit hole

141
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,551
Okay so I'm going to present you what I have as a mini

142
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Episode

143
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:53,695
Till I get to 11345 West

144
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,487
Picture against the University of Texas

145
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
Assisted Austin and the story starts

146
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
With this

147
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
Yes I am I'm sitting in my living room

148
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,655
On my couch

149
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,007
Members of course I'm listening on my computer to the oral argument

150
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
Central issue here

151
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
Is weather the University

152
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,895
His name is Dylan schweers

153
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,735
The lawyer now but at the time he was a second-year lost

154
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
A JD candidate

155
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,623
At Northwestern pritzker School of Law

156
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,439
And the case itself doesn't really matter for our purposes

157
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,767
What matters is the rhythm of the conversation

158
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Neptune

159
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
To test

160
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
Strict scrutiny

161
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,143
You have the lawyer but Ryan making his case

162
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,007
The traffic and then you

163
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,615
Because the clutch is supposed to raise it on its own in this case Ruth Bader Ginsburg

164
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
I'm sitting there listening

165
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:51,551
Dylan doesn't think much of this particular moment because he knows from his Professor I'm Tanya Jacoby I am a professor of

166
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
Buffalo at Northwestern

167
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,647
Pritzker school of law that interruptions are just

168
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,463
Part of the deal the justices do interrupt The Advocate

169
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,487
Constantly the.

170
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
Suffix

171
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,047
The rule is that the justice

172
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
This is our loud

173
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
To interrupt

174
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
The blow lead lawyer

175
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,959
But not the other way around there is this rule that says

176
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:13,055
Directly if a Justice begins talking you as The Advocate

177
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,127
Cease talking immediately lawyers are not allowed

178
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
To interrupt

179
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
Which is why

180
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
I was listening

181
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,575
This other moment really cut his ear

182
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:31,487
It's a moment where the lawyer Burt Ryan is talking

183
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,791
Am I your steps in

184
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
Mary Hughes

185
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,607
Skirt back down

186
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
In Greece

187
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Sufficient

188
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
But then

189
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
You still haven't

190
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,031
Get away from them

191
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
Give me another

192
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
Well I say

193
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,383
Start to kind of bicker

194
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,711
And Justice Sotomayor are essentially having an argument amongst

195
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,759
Styles going back and forth back and forth

196
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
Virtually

197
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:01,951
Rex.

198
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,071
So much so

199
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
Vet

200
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,191
Justice Sotomayor said let me finish my point

201
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
Say let me finish my point

202
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
That is a

203
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
That to me was very striking

204
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
He's right

205
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
For their edges

206
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,503
Chelsea's a subordinate walking into their house

207
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,295
He's like that's against the rules

208
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
It keeps listening

209
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
They start to notice that this moment

210
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
Kind of keeps happening

211
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,791
Does a critical mass

212
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,887
Again and again the female justices just keep getting interrupted

213
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
And I just

214
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:48,543
I could not believe the amount of times it happened I'm I remember I opened up a word doc and I wrote

215
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,591
And said term paper idea

216
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:57,247
Men interrupting women on the Supreme Court

217
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,831
At this point my ladies in the house might be thinking

218
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,671
Okay Dillon

219
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,975
Gambling is going on in here

220
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:12,351
Real shocker my fiance about this I think she would describe the whole thing as ironic

221
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:18,239
So I'll let you know I mean the skull is from linguist

222
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:23,103
Two psychologists of showing that women get interrupted

223
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:29,503
In pretty much every forum

224
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,647
What's so striking about a DS

225
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,671
Is that

226
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Health information

227
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
Oh I'm sorry that I

228
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,631
Yeah so men interrupting women not exactly front-page news but

229
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:51,519
No one had ever done a systematic quantifying of this phenomenon on the Supreme Court

230
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,615
So what you decided to do was

231
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:02,015
A call the audio from Supreme Court years 2004 to 2015

232
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
Into the computer

233
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
This is hundreds of thousands words

234
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,535
Into the computer word transcripts not actual audio but whatever and they did hand code a few additional years including one

235
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
Sandra Day O'Connor was on the court

236
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,143
But to identify the actual Interruption points

237
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
How to computer look for dashes

238
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,519
Every time anyone gets interrupted on the Supreme Court

239
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,335
Two little dashes pop-up in the transcript

240
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,407
So Tanya and Dylan create an algorithm

241
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,943
That would be able to count

242
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
The dashes that were interruption

243
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,695
Let me guess let me guess meme

244
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,279
The female justices were interrupted the the most number

245
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,839
Well technically no

246
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
Really the most

247
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,447
Number of interruptions actually happened between two men

248
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
Scalia and

249
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,311
Did not get along

250
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
General bases

251
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,127
Except

252
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
Houston

253
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
The state

254
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
Justice League

255
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,295
Portuguese

256
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,903
Justice Scalia who died last year than conservative brierley liberal

257
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,719
He spent about 21 years on the court together

258
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,047
During that time they were constantly up in each other's

259
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,839
And

260
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:25,471
Justice Scalia interrupted Justice Breyer four times more often than any other individual Justice

261
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,567
Except for Justice Breyer who was interrupting Justice Scalia has twice as much

262
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,431
Rosso ideology transgender that's kind of don't know

263
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,735
Hopeful no no no

264
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,319
Because that's fat between Breyer and Scalia

265
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,903
It's really an operation even though these two men were

266
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
We interrupt each other

267
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Inovalon

268
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,511
We still managed to find a very large Ginger fact

269
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:54,655
So when they compiled all of the interruptions together

270
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
+ reaching back

271
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,519
Toq years when Sandra Day O'Connor was on the court

272
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:04,127
They looked at how many interruptions were happening to the female dresses

273
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,687
It's versus the men the women are Interrupted about

274
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:11,807
3 times as much as the average man

275
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
Three times as much

276
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
1%

277
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Tus temperature

278
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,887
I simply waited with an expectation that we would see that patent

279
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,983
But I think that what's really surprising is that our impression that the

280
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
The Advocate

281
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,775
We interrupting the just

282
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,311
And that that was gendered

283
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,639
Meaning the male lawyers the lowly lawyers

284
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,711
Even they felt they could interrupt the female dress

285
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,503
But that was shown to be

286
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
Systemic

287
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,319
Was really shocking because

288
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,111
Speech patterns

289
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,439
Like interruptions are a product of dominance

290
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,743
And so men interrupt a lot

291
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
Because they have

292
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,559
Traditionally been dominant within Society

293
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,631
But that means that if a woman is an imposition of

294
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:03,007
Clearly demarcated higher power than the man then the man should not be interrupting the woman

295
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,151
And in terms of the justices interrupting each other was there one master interrupter

296
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,199
Yes in fact absolutely

297
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,063
See if you can guess who that is

298
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,599
Interrupting RBG

299
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,695
He is the Swing Vote

300
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,023
Considered by some to be the most powerful man in America

301
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
Justice Kennedy

302
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
Hands down

303
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,423
He interrupted the female justices the most

304
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
Which

305
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,007
If the number of interruptions is any indication

306
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:40,895
You might be under the impression that his opinion is more important than everybody else's

307
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
On the court

308
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,455
Which is

309
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:49,855
Rude but maybe not wrong he was number one and then he was followed by Justice Scalia and

310
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
Chief justice rehnquist

311
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,671
We have some great examples

312
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,719
One of my favorites is he in trouble

313
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,023
Timer three unrelated

314
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,327
Justice Ginsburg

315
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:04,447
Suppose there were three unrelated case and then Advocate stops responding to him and then about

316
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,519
30 seconds 45 seconds later he says

317
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,383
Interrupted Justice Ginsburg I inadvertently interrupted just

318
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,807
And then went on to ask another

319
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,599
There is another

320
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Great example

321
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
When

322
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,207
I was with Justice O'Connor

323
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Dresses

324
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
Scalise's question and I think

325
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,071
Rochester Turner's asking to

326
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,119
Justice Kennedy chimes in and says

327
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167
I think this gets to what Justice

328
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
Sister Connor was that

329
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,495
Is your answer

330
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
2

331
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
The last time

332
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,175
But then went on with his question so even if it wasn't really what you was trying to get it he had a good idea what just

333
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
What's Ohio's saying

334
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,991
What is Justice O'Connor doing message

335
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
So

336
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,599
Don Antonio actually found in this linguistic analysis

337
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
That woman's

338
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Faced with this

339
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
Garage

340
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
Interruption

341
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,999
They've actually

342
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,279
Found ways

343
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,815
Whether consciously or not

344
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
To adapt

345
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,143
And almost

346
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
Fight back

347
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
But how about we talk about that after the break

348
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,591
I'll remind you again for your turn back

Back to the store

369
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,439
This is more perfect MCAT up and brought here with Julia Longoria

370
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:06,559
We're talking about interruptions on the Supreme Court so if you are one of these female justices

371
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,143
Who and you're incessantly getting interrupted by the man

372
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,727
I'm curious like how how did the female justices adapt

373
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,543
SoDo Netanya noticed

374
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
That

375
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
When women first

376
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
Get on the court

377
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
They do this

378
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:21,919
Thing in there

379
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
They caught the lights

380
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:30,367
They ask if they can ask a question

381
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:35,743
May I apologize for asking questions

382
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,791
But may I ask you a question

383
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,583
And during that time

384
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
The man who jumped

385
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
Justice Kagan

386
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:51,615
Let me just finish this gets interrupted again and again and again

387
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:58,015
Can I ask and then

388
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:07,231
I don't know not really you can't

389
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,303
But over time

390
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,863
Tanya and Owen find that eventually

391
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,911
The female justices

392
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,727
Find a way to adapt

393
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
Situation

394
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,799
What we didn't notice overtime is that

395
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
Their use of that language

396
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,103
Definitely.

397
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,639
All four of the women

398
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
Sure

399
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,991
Significant reductions in the use of that flight language

400
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
Some of the justice

401
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,063
Was never quite get down to the level

402
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
Mail

403
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,671
Speech most of the men into the court not using that language much at all

404
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
Ruth Bader Ginsburg

405
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,279
Having been on the court the longest out of all the women

406
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,559
Seems to be

407
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
Very good at

408
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,167
What was the first reason for

409
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
Nothing more direct

410
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
So instead of saying

411
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
May I ask

412
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,823
You're jumping it

413
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
Understand can you point to the statute

414
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
Where's that

415
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
Or where should we disagree with the lower pinyin

416
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,711
Have we ever

417
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
Analyzed

418
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,319
Question a Justice will

419
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,391
The temperature dropped and the woman will just continue talkin

420
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,927
And often when the floor

421
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,999
Why do women start to behave like men exact

422
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,767
Which

423
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,071
Tends to fend off interruptions

424
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,607
2 points

425
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,423
Take the case of Sonia Sotomayor

426
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
Coward

427
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,799
And targeting

428
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,383
She is a woman Supreme Court Justice

429
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,407
Latina

430
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
End

431
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,735
In a lot of ways she should actually be

432
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:36,063
Owning the anti interruptions game of all the female Justice

433
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
She's the one that adapted most

434
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,135
Quickly to the less polite

435
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:45,023
Dial instead of speaking like a man most quickly and I think as a result is seen as aggressive

436
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,583
A terror on the bench nasty

437
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,607
Overly aggressive

438
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
A bit of a boy blunt

439
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,679
Even pulling

440
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:58,079
Will her Infamous have her that some of talked about who practice before her flare up at all today

441
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:02,687
Sonia Sotomayor

442
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,271
Roseanne Barr

443
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,319
And so I've had a lot of people

444
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
Odessa

445
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,391
Sotomayor she's very aggressive

446
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,415
She told sloth

447
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,695
And the numbers that released

448
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,255
She talks about as much as the average man

449
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,583
Sotomayor is also the woman who gets interrupted

450
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,351
The most

451
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,911
So you're still have your damned either way right

452
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
Now

453
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
Maybe the most

454
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
Surprising

455
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
Think that they found in this study

456
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,503
Is that as more and more women join the court

457
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,319
First you just had Sandra Day O'Connor

458
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,855
Nrpg joined

459
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,439
Today you have Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan

460
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
You think

461
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,255
The men might get used to it

462
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,559
Am I cool it on the interruptions

463
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
And

464
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
No

465
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
It was

466
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,215
The opposite

467
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,263
Number of interruptions

468
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
Has

469
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
Increase

470
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,359
It's certainly as they're Movin On the cord

471
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,895
We can't say for sure that that's

472
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,175
The cause or effect

473
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,967
At the same time

474
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,527
But given that there is so much interrupt

475
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
Turn off women disc

476
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,343
Proportionately and the rate at which

477
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,367
Women are being entrapped

478
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
Just seems to be increasing

479
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:20,000
Play Lost Boy years since they've been three women on the car

480
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,816
It does seem to be

481
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,376
In line with other research in areas such

482
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,168
Congress and the boardroom

483
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,216
It show that as more than

484
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,544
Into the traditionally male domain the men become a

485
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,312
Actually more aggressive

486
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,104
They're probably getting used to the idea

487
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,896
Refute I could women

488
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,968
They can live with that but as the numbers increased who you know

489
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,504
Significance to reality

490
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,552
In the men's.

491
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
In a really

492
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
Talking to women

493
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
Life

494
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,696
It could be that there's a soda pump that eventually get over

495
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,768
Maybe if we have half a

496
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,304
The courting women

497
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,888
Eventually the men would settle down and get used to the idea

498
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
Maybe

499
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,216
Maybe

500
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,032
RBG get this question all the time

501
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,824
At the most senior woman on the court

502
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
When do you think

503
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,384
It will be enough

504
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,992
Will there be enough women on the court

505
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,552
And my answer is

506
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
When there are nine

507
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,976
