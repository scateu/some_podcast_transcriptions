00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:15,104
Hey I'm Jared I'm rod and today

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,712
Not an entire more perfect story just something that you need to know right now

6
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:25,344
Supreme Court's about to hear a case that apparently could turn the country's legislative map

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,368
Upside down

8
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,672
More perfect sean rameswaram

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,952
Kentucky from here

10
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,024
Hello Jad

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,048
Hello America

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:39,168
So what's up with some contacts Republicans controlled a lot of legislators in 2010

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,216
And there was also a sense of

14
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:41,984
Does that year

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,032
Which meant that a whole lot of Republicans

16
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:47,360
Got to redraw a whole lot of legislative Maps

17
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,664
And a lot of those Mavs benefited

18
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,688
Republican

19
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,736
Democrats do this to

20
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,040
But today's case Gill V Whitford

21
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,320
Is about a Republican

22
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00,416
A map in Wisconsin where for example in 2012

23
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,976
Democrats got 53% of the vote

24
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,024
But only 39% of the

25
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,328
Republican made that happen

26
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,864
Buy packing Democrats

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,912
Into Super Democratic districts

28
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,216
Weather Boats were essentially wasted

29
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,496
And also by

30
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,776
Kraken Democrats

31
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,080
Into mostly Republican districts

32
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,616
Weather boats

33
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,152
We're essentially wasted

34
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,992
In a move that could have a huge bearing on the future of American politics this

35
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,552
Supreme Court on Monday agreed to take off Annex

36
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,576
Explosive cake

37
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,976
Whether lawmakers in Wisconsin's republican-led legislature went too far in 2011 when they read through the snow

38
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:38,816
State electoral map to make it harder for Democrats to win legislative races

39
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:43,936
I will make the Supreme Court case all the bigger a big deal right now

40
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,704
Is

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
The timer

42
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,056
This is the first time in more than a decade

43
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,848
But it's going to take up the question of drawing lines

44
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Partisan game

45
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,968
And this is Justin Levitt he teaches bought at Loyola in Los Angeles

46
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,040
It's going to do that right on the eve of

47
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,344
Everybody redrawing lines everywhere

48
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,672
Local District State District's congressional districts

49
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,584
After the census in 2020 all sorts of different bodies will redraw all sorts of different lines and this case

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,864
Will help decide

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,632
How and where

52
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,216
And if the court can crack this nut it'll be solving one of the biggest

53
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,240
Baddest

54
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,800
And oldest abuses of power

55
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,080
In our democracy

56
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,640
It goes back to before there was an America

57
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,224
So there were problems with rotten boroughs in England

58
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,784
I wish were Century districts with no people in them

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
The nevertheless elected representatives

60
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,880
In this country in America

61
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,208
The allegations going these fees are also contested all the way back

62
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,816
The allegations are that Patrick Henry tried to gerrymander James Mattis

63
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,840
Out of

64
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
The very first Congress

65
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,912
Hemp seeds in Virginia

66
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,704
Because he was so upset with

67
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,984
The Constitution

68
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
The word itself

69
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,848
Comes from in 1812 attempt

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
2

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,176
Change the lines in Massachusetts

72
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,480
It is named after a governor mess

73
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
Elbridge Gerry

74
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,552
I meant if you go to

75
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,416
Northeastern Massachusetts they will tell you passionately that is called the gerrymandering out of Jerry Mannix

76
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,512
That's something that people actually argue about it over Massachusetts

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,864
To the allegations were that did Elbridge Gerry created a district that snake

78
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,192
Around the northern cape and suburbs essentially

79
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:25,312
I it was ridiculed in a political cartoon of time is looking more like a salamander than a district

80
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,360
And the portmanteau is born

81
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
I gerrymander

82
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,712
And since that moment we've been living with this unfortunate word

83
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
And it's unfortunate problem

84
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,088
And it turns out it's a really hard problem to solve

85
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
Leavitt says you can't just

86
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
Hit reset

87
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,696
Draw some rectangles and call it a day

88
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,488
That's not the way people live

89
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:50,400
Nobody is ever bought a house because it fit the last perfect spot on the last perfect square grid and last perfect develop

90
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,728
In a square City in a square County in a square state

91
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:58,336
The way we live is sloppy and messy

92
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
And organic

93
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:05,248
See that I find an interesting cuz one of the one of the conversation people have about districts a lot of times it's like

94
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,392
Look at this District

95
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,696
The truth is like if you look at it like

96
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,720
Voting rights.

97
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,768
He'll do that to try and keep

98
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
Exactly since together

99
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
Right

100
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,143
Totally I think the best example to look at here is

101
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
Illinois's 4th Congressional

102
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,543
It looks like this weird jaw the skeletal job trying to eat like

103
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
Lake Michigan

104
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,615
People actually called the ear

105
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,151
Ida chemist because

106
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
Horizontal so

107
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,503
If you put it that way we look like you're much too big trunk

108
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039
Connected by basically this

109
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Straightener

110
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,111
Looks really tacky it's running up a highway

111
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
But

112
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
This was drawn by democrats

113
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
So United

114
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
2

115
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,255
Similar

116
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,047
But geographically you know

117
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
Apart

118
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
Latino District right

119
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,143
How to create a cohesive

120
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
Block

121
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,983
And it's actually if you look at it that way

122
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
It's a very

123
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,519
Good

124
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
Helpful

125
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,591
This is it gives a community voice

126
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
Right so in the end the question is

127
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
How do you

128
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,967
Distinguish between what's giving a community of voice

129
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
And what's

130
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
Straight up

131
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
Scandalous

132
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
Cheating

133
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:16,927
It all starts with designing districts around real communities that have something in common with each other

134
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,255
It turns out that's really hard to

135
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Do

136
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,071
When your legislator

137
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,911
Focused intently on the next election

138
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,471
And that's my time and time again

139
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:34,079
Gerrymandering has ended up in front of the Supreme Court's of the United States

140
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,151
The nine justices in DC have to do what

141
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
Congress doesn't really care to

142
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,271
The Constitution does not require the

143
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Cigar

144
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,111
This is Justice Stevens back in 2004

145
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
Partisan gerrymandering

146
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,695
English

147
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,023
Enables representatives to choose

148
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
Undemocratic

149
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,167
Constitution

150
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
Malpractice

151
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,031
The case was beef vs Jubilee as the last time the Supreme Court

152
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823
Dealt with partisan gerrymandering

153
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,127
And just as Kennedy in the first

154
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
The Jubilee year

155
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
Basically said

156
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,759
You legal community of America need to solve this for us

157
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,551
Or we are in big trouble

158
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:20,415
Weekly Standard

159
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,255
Now we have in our own Jersey

160
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
Geographical

161
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
Compactness

162
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,399
But I just don't think we have

163
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
Numbers

164
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,775
One person one vote

165
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,615
But beyond that

166
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,967
And the Justice of the deathly looked at Sea trying to fix this invite versus juvelier

167
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,527
These are people who love rules they love test

168
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,111
So they came up with a whole bunch and no one could agree on any of them

169
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,951
They're looking at the big Statewide picture versus the local little

170
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Sure they were

171
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:59,583
Using racial standards from the Voting Rights Act and not it was like a hot mess

172
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
Of socialist

173
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
And Kennedy could see this

174
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,191
And what he said is

175
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
Sitting in the middle

176
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
As he often is

177
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,823
The most powerful man in the country by many stretches

178
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
The courts

179
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,895
Should be in this business

180
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
Yes

181
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,015
But I haven't heard a standard that lets us decide how much is

182
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
Is too much yet

183
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
So give me some

184
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,135
It was as public a plea to

185
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
Lawyers

186
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,743
To bring cases to help him work through the appropriate test

187
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
As I think anybody's ever

188
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
I'm sort of like this

189
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
Public

190
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
Challenge

191
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
Who out there can solve this

192
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,935
And and now

193
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,495
May finally have a solution

194
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,079
Allow me to introduce the efficiency Gap

195
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:48,479
The efficiency Gap efficiency Gap is essentially this

196
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:53,087
Relatively simple math equation for measuring Parts in jail

197
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:58,719
The idea is if the justices want to know was its districts fairly drawn

198
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,511
Or are some legislators up to no good

199
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,863
All we have to do is grab a calculator plug in a few numbers and Ben

200
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,631
They get there

201
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,191
To political scientist came up with it

202
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,007
And then a bunch of mathematicians weighed in on it

203
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,823
And one of them was Professor Moon duchin

204
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,919
You can call me moon or Professor teaching she works for Tufts University in Boston

205
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,223
I do geometry topology

206
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,807
Group Theory and Dynamics so little bit of everything across the mask

207
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,855
Just as a heads up with all is dust

208
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,903
Acknowledge the existence of a maths

209
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:33,023
Moon co-authored a paper titled a formula goes to court which is essentially What's Happening Here

210
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
Supreme Court's going to consider

211
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,631
Weather this efficiency Gap formula passes muster

212
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
Is this equation a

213
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,959
Reasonable standard

214
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,007
From measuring partisan German

215
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:50,431
The efficiency Gap formula does that in a couple of different ways most importantly by measuring what

216
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,967
Called wasted vote

217
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,271
And wheezing votes by definition

218
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
They are

219
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
The number of votes that you got

220
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
Minus 50%

221
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
If you want

222
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,719
In other words there's a voice that you wasted while winning

223
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,791
So if Republicans got 60% in a district

224
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
Wastage would be tempered

225
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,423
Okay okay so if I got 10 volts but only in five I wasted

226
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
But

227
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
Or

228
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
They're all the votes if you lost

229
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,847
So in that same district the Democrats got 40%

230
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,943
And so that was 40% wasted because I didn't go towards electing a Democrat

231
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,527
Okay so wasted for the losing side is basically

232
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
All of the votes

233
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,343
In a race where you lost

234
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,879
Yeah that's a waste

235
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,927
And then the efficiency Gap

236
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,951
Is quite simply

237
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,719
You take

238
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,511
All the ways to vote for a

239
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
Across the entire state

240
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,119
All the wasted votes for b u takes a difference

241
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,911
As a proportion of the total turnout

242
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,215
Efficiency

243
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
Subtraction

244
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,103
It's party a wasted votes - party B's wasted votes

245
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
Divided

246
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,431
By the total number of people who voted

247
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,991
That gives you a number that measures

248
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
Gerrymandering

249
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,063
It's is addition and subtraction

250
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,879
With a smattering of division it is so not scary

251
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:07,231
So Republican wasted vote - Democrat wasted votes

252
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
/ the

253
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
Total number of

254
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,583
Of overall volume

255
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,655
That's that's the that's what we're trying to measure

256
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
Here yeah

257
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,239
Why would that work as a measuring of gerrymandering

258
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,263
So

259
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,663
Take a look a purple State like Wisconsin where you know you have Democrats winning and you have Republicans winning and they're both wasting

260
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
Boats

261
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,247
They're both winning elections losing elections and

262
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,295
And every one of those races

263
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,391
They're wasting both because I wasted vote as anything over 50

264
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,695
If you want 80%

265
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
And

266
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:42,559
Anything you lost if you lost right so wasted Just Happening across the board

267
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:46,143
But theoretically it's happening on both side so all the wasted should

268
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,703
Do canceling out in Wisconsin have this picture where

269
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,263
Democrats won 53% of the vote

270
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,079
But only one 39% of the sea

271
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,895
It's a Democrat for wasting a lot more the Republic

272
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
Tons more

273
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
And that might mean

274
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
That they're sort of this

275
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
Pattern

276
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,527
Of wasted votes

277
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
Across the entire state

278
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,111
The entire map might have been drawn

279
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
To favor one side

280
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:13,535
Is that like if you plug in the numbers in the equation you if you got a big number that means lots of ways to get a little number that means

281
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
0 is that is that essentially it or is it

282
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
Something like that

283
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Really yeah

284
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
That's cool

285
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
It literally is like

286
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,591
Is it like that

287
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,407
There's actually a way that we don't need that

288
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,223
Moon's got even easier way

289
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
To understand this

290
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,551
A shortcut

291
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
I can tell you what it is

292
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
Do you want notice right now

293
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
No effort

294
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:06,527
This is my perfect I'm Jared I'm right here with Shaun Robbins firm we're talking about the ancient problem of gerrymandering

295
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
A solution may be about to fly into the

296
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
The Supreme Court on the gleaming wings

297
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
Matt

298
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
You mentioned that there was a there's a short

299
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:18,559
Truck yeah you know if you don't like the math that we were doing a little deficient scab

300
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,863
Professor duchin gave me this

301
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,655
Disorder handiwork around

302
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:26,751
That'll probably make it a lot easier to understand the whole wasted vote

303
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,079
It just involves comparing how many votes you got in the race

304
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,639
How many seats you got in that same race

305
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,175
All you have to do

306
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
Is Teak

307
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
Your vote margin

308
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
And double it

309
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,319
Efficiency Gap tells you that should be your seat March

310
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,903
So you got 53% of the votes

311
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,231
So that's a margin of 3% over. Why

312
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Doublet

313
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
You should get 56% of the sea

314
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
If you get

315
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
Try this with me now

316
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,399
You get 60% of votes

317
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
So how many seats should you get

318
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
Okay so

319
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
I got 60% of

320
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,799
I need 50% to win

321
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,847
Size of track that off I got

322
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
10% left

323
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
And doubled

324
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
That's 20%

325
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,015
And then I add back the original 50%

326
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
I won

327
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
And that's

328
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
70% of the seats

329
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
You got it

330
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,207
The one I just went to 60% why do I double it

331
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,743
So that's an excellent question

332
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,047
And what's

333
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,607
Because of a kind of complicated answer to that

334
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
Interesting

335
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,447
This a well if you look at elections

336
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,287
Don't believe the margin is what actually tends to happen

337
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,639
Okay so these guys Professor duchin mean Stephanopoulos and McGee

338
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,687
The dude who came up with the efficiency Gap

339
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:45,599
What they say is when you look at elections across the country and compare how many votes the winning party gets to have

340
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,135
How many seats the winning party gets

341
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,951
The winners tend to get some extra seats

342
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,999
This idea is called the seat bonus

343
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,071
The idea that if you win by a little you should get a cushion

344
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,863
In your governing majority

345
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:03,519
So it's like what are systems kind of funky let's let's roll with it and here we baked the funk into the into the formula we baked in

346
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,823
In the funk I love it that should be the subtitle

347
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,383
His genius of Brandon

348
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,711
Grateful they're taking something descriptive this is what actually happened

349
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:16,063
Turning around do something normative which says this is what should

350
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,623
So well let's look at

351
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Waupaca Wisconsin

352
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
The courts of the gerrymandering quotes

353
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,743
Did in fact prevent Wisconsin Democrat

354
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
From being able to

355
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,327
Translate their vote into seat as affect

356
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
Is Wisconsin Republican

357
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,167
So Wisconsin in

358
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
2008

359
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
Dems get

360
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
57% of the vote

361
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
So

362
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
What percent of seats should they get

363
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,151
This is according to the Matthew just did you can do it

364
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,455
Okay 57 650

365
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,015
I got 7 * 2 is 14

366
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,807
+ the original 50

367
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
WhatsApp

368
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:54,207
84% of the seats you got it exactly God

369
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
I have this

370
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,095
Instead in 2008 they get 52%

371
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,399
Cancel that suggests that

372
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:07,263
View through lines of efficiency Gap things are stacked against them by quite a bit

373
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
Right in Seoul

374
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
That's how this works it becomes

375
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
Only a way to compare

376
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,407
You vote margin to see margin

377
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,991
Not moons feeling about all this deficiency Gap the shortcut

378
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
It's a good start

379
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
But it's just

380
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
The start

381
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,135
You know I really respect the effort to take

382
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,463
Something so complicated and boiled down into a single number but

383
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,255
It fundamentally can't beat

384
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,559
Done that simply because

385
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,119
People are way more complicated than just

386
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
What number we are

387
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:39,007
We are geography we our history our race were so many things

388
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
You're going to need a few different

389
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,823
Metrics at once

390
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,407
The fear is that that's what the courts been allergic to is

391
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:49,503
You have several different metrics how do you combine them and how do you decide when enough is enough

392
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:56,415
By Good Fortune we're now finally in a position with been a long time that partisan gerrymandering

393
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
Rendering keeps peeing

394
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,511
But you can keep seeing take down the road by the court

395
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,791
Good news is

396
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,863
They may have some postponed and delayed just long enough

397
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,167
But now we have some really good alternative

398
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,495
Most promising things this coming down the pike is

399
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,543
The use of computers

400
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,919
Dreamed of this for decades but computing power just hasn't been

401
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
Nearly ready

402
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
To contend

403
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,015
With the big data of

404
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,295
The three District

405
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
Problem

406
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
That's because

407
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
We're doing some

408
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,951
Phenomenally complicated, notorious we've got

409
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:36,351
This, that's what matters

410
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,143
Accounting

411
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:43,519
Supreme Court isn't quite at combinatorics but if Justice Kennedy likes the efficiency Gap

412
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,591
The Court's decision could dramatically change the way

413
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
State Street

414
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:53,247
And if the court can Embrace this standard moons hoping it will go for others down the road

415
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,855
Ones that more fully consider all the kinds of connections

416
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
That make up a community

417
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
They're just

418
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,743
Phenomenally many ways to break down

419
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
Millions of people

420
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
Into

421
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
Doesn't exist

422
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,887
If you just enumerate all the possibilities

423
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,679
So that's the biggest day that you're going to find

424
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,471
Bigger than medical problems bigger than

425
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Astronomical

426
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,359
Asking a computer to really understand all the possibilities has been Out Of Reach

427
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,175
But what's happened recently is both

428
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:26,527
Computing power and the algorithms used to study this have been getting better and better

429
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,135
Forecastle understood how to constrain that search space more

430
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,207
What we're moving towards is a Time

431
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,535
I won't be able to cut down the space of possibilities that you have to search

432
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,119
And at the same time computers will be getting more powerful until those meet in the middle

433
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,911
In computers can really see all about

434
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
So what numbers are

435
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,543
You're too big for mathematicians to even wrap their heads around when you can

436
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,847
Computers oh no other way around

437
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,151
Applications are very comfortable

438
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,503
Infinity is the computers that have had to catch up

439
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,807
Computer need to catch up

440
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,111
How do we expect 9th Supreme Court Justice

441
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:07,231
What happens when computers can really explore

442
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
The space of possibilities

443
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
Is it they can build

444
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,375
A bell curve of the properties of all the different Maps

445
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,935
Soap computers are going to do it for us

446
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,983
Create Maps app on maps

447
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,519
Zapata maps that

448
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,823
Together will give us an idea of what a disc

449
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Scripture look like

450
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,687
And then you look at Wisconsin's actual plans legislature enacted

451
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,991
You'll see where it falls on the bell curve

452
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,039
Is it in the nice meaty part in the middle

453
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,831
Or is it an outlier that's

454
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,623
Just out along the tail of bell curve

455
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
Pretty

456
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,695
Persuasive enough

457
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,487
Kind of outlier analysis

458
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,839
It should be pretty comfortable for court because they do this all the time for other kinds of

459
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,375
Legal standards

460
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
What is

461
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
Perfect this

462
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
Look like

463
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
What is something that is just

464
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
Anyone

465
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,031
Regardless

466
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,079
Political ideology could look at it and say

467
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
Oh yeah.

468
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,383
Yahoo questions

469
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,199
It's fun to do the Rorschach blot

470
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,783
Version of detecting gerrymandering

471
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,111
One of the things that my group is working on is like

472
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,159
A swipe left swipe right

473
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,231
Promoting District Uganda C District

474
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:17,119
Little bit of information and decide if you think it was hot or not that's hilarious that's great you have that can I play

475
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,935
Coming up coming up for congressional district

476
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:25,311
Is that were calling a gerrymander

477
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:29,151
Great so I mean that's always going to be fun but

478
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,479
Just that Contour isn't always showing you what's really going on

479
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:36,831
It's not just the outline is also where the people are and how they're split

480
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,415
Wright cuts of the district and not just its boundary

481
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,975
That's got a lot of information about its legitimacy

482
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,791
We're trying to throw a lot of

483
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,351
20th and 21st century math

484
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,423
At the district render does a graph for a network

485
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
I think that's going to produce some new insight

486
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:57,055
Before that happens does the Supreme Court have to say in this Kilby Whitford case

487
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,127
Hey partisan gerrymandering is is wicked unconstitutional

488
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,943
Wilkes the court has already told us

489
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:08,831
That partisan gerrymandering is is just a symbol that they can they can throw out plans of partisan gerrymandering

490
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,111
They just don't know how yet

491
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,159
Right and so

492
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,183
This case

493
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
Came up

494
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,511
With efficiency Gap as its centerpiece

495
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,791
In the future

496
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,351
Cases may come up with a outlier analysis

497
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,167
As their centerpieces 30 there going to be more than one

498
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,215
A bite at the sample

499
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,775
I regard efficiency Gap as a great

500
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
Stop

501
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,847
Towards convincing courts not to be scared

502
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,663
Adjudicating partisan gerrymandering

503
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,711
It's a really good opening Salvo

504
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
Great well

505
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:40,575
Thank you so much for all your time I can't wait to download gerrymander

506
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,879
And meet my next

507
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
