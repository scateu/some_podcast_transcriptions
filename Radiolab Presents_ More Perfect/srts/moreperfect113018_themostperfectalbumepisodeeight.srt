WNYC Studio

00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:18,432
It's me chat album ride here with more perfect season 3 than most perfect album we are Marching through all the 27 amendments to the

4
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,200
Constitution

5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,736
Playing songs

6
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:24,576
From the album we put together along with audio liner notes that

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:28,160
Digging a little to what each of these men's meet with now

8
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:32,512
Today we have three three songs we put these three together

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,280
Because

10
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,304
They represent

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,072
3

12
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,608
Times in history when

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,168
Collectively we decided to

14
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
Make

15
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,472
Would seem like

16
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,496
Small tweaks

17
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,288
To our democracy

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,080
The small tweaks ended up having

19
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:46,848
Arguably

20
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,128
Mass Effect

21
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,456
Fundamentally Shifting the way that we do things here in America

22
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,480
For Better or Worse

23
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,040
Is that generally or up to

24
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,624
We got three Amendments of that sort three songs to go along with it

25
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,160
From the most perfect album

26
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,696
Most perfect album. Org

27
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,280
We're going to start with number 12

28
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,584
Probably not the man that you've ever thought about but

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,632
Producer Rachel Cusick has

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,424
And she brings you this

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
Lighter now

32
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,240
Imagine a world where

33
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,336
Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president people

34
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,616
Donald J Trump

35
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:24,992
And the Democratic nominee for president Hillary Clinton Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton

36
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,296
Both run for president of the United State

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,624
Trump wins Hillary loses

38
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,928
But instead of bowing out

39
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,488
Hillary Clinton becomes Trump's Vice

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,048
Let me respond to that because that's

41
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,072
Horrifying

42
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,680
Different kinds of campaigns there and it's a crazy thought

43
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,496
Donald Trump's ideas

44
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,520
Aren't just different

45
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,848
They are dangerously incoherent

46
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:57,248
She has no natural talents people attacked each other's character do we want his finger

47
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,528
You're anywhere near the button

48
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:06,720
She's one of the worst secretaries of State in the history of their mental stability

49
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,000
The psychiatrist

50
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,560
Explain his affection for tyrants

51
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
But you were

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
Totally out of control

53
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,656
I said there's a person

54
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,704
With a temperament that's got a problem

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,728
Their voters

56
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:23,104
Half of trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables

57
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
They're not deplorable

58
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:29,760
The racist sexist homophobic xenophobic

59
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:35,648
Islamophobic you-name-it lock her up is right

60
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,000
How do you lie to the FBI

61
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,048
And now you're running for president

62
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
How does that happen

63
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:49,728
I'm in no world would you pair these two people up and then expect them to coleta Country

64
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
But

65
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,896
For the first few years of our country

66
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:03,296
That's how elections worked a bunch of people ran for office person with the most votes became president and the person with you roast beef

67
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
Vice president

68
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,136
Very quickly things went South

69
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:14,560
1800 Thomas Jefferson squares off against John Adams Jefferson side basically called Adams a hideous for Mac

70
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:20,448
Adam Sandler's back saying that Jefferson was the son of a half-breed Indian Squaw

71
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:26,848
And everybody jumps to the conclusion that there is no way that you guys can serve together

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,408
That our country needs a better way of doing us

73
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
And that way was

74
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
At 12.

75
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
12

76
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,320
Election of President and Vice Pres

77
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,672
The electors shall meet in their respective States

78
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,488
And vote by ballot for President and Vice President

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
One of them

80
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
At least

81
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,352
Shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves

82
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
They shall name in their ballots

83
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,448
The person voted for as president

84
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
And in distinct ballots

85
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,776
The person voted for as Vice Pres

86
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:02,176
From then on one person from each party would run with a chosen psychic and as long as they weren't from the same state elections

87
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:05,760
Could carry on as normal without any Force Partnerships

88
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,320
I can't help but Wonder though if

89
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
Maybe

90
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,000
In some small way this amendment fueled some of the hostility from the 2016 election

91
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,095
Take away the pressure to be civilized

92
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,991
Rachel Cusick

93
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:41,599
That lineup for the 12th Amendment another band that tackled the 12th

94
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
On was buried album

95
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,951
Happens to be one of my favorite bands

96
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:50,559
I've been listening this guy for like 10 years from the band octopus project

97
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
Guichos

98
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
The 12th Amendment for a track

99
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,679
Without knowing too much about the amendment itself

100
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,263
Unlike the more famous amendments like the first of the second

101
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
The 12th is

102
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,079
Is pretty dry and mostly deals with

103
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,895
Procedural details rather than describing

104
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
Specific individual rights

105
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
So we weren't

106
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,247
Completely sure how to approach it

107
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,575
When researching the amendment a little more

108
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,415
Especially in the NSA we found called who's afraid of the 12th Amendment

109
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
It became clear that

110
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,767
The dryness and procedural language was

111
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
The point

112
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
That the Federalists

113
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,863
Believe that an intricate structure of

114
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,935
Checks and balances was a more effective deterrent

115
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
To a tyrannical government

116
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,543
Van enumeration of specific rights

117
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Or parts

118
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,103
Barriers as they called that approach

119
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,407
Can I say something

120
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,967
Really interesting to us about the concept

121
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
The series of

122
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:47,391
Dispassionate systems and mechanisms being as much a defender of Liberty as some of the more

123
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
Dramatic

124
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,975
Flaming sword amendments in the Bill of Rights

125
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,263
The looping mechanical clacking sound in the track

126
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,871
Connects with that image for us

127
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:15,551
And I really like how the interlocking rhythms of

128
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:22,719
The drums and the clacking sound provide the basis for the more dramatic

129
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:29,119
Sense and Thurman's to enter on top of to continue the musical metaphor

130
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:35,519
Four of the different approaches in the different amendments

131
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,823
I hope you and racetrack

132
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,455
Text

133
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:18,687
You can hear that full-song from the ox

134
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,503
This project or any of these songs on the most perfect album

135
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,807
At the most perfect album. Org

136
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,327
That's okay so we're going to skip right ahead from 12 to 20

137
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,655
Because they both came about around the same time they both deal with the

138
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
The oddness

139
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,471
Of Elections this particular one

140
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
Number 20

141
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,799
Triciclos a

142
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,103
Devilish little window of time that

143
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
Occurred

144
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
After an election

145
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
Before a person

146
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Took office

147
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,295
Sometimes called the lame duck period Which makes it sound gentle and harmless

148
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
But

149
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,111
The Julia Longoria looks plain

150
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
It's not

151
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:08,607
It's a small Niche but I'm certainly a 20th Amendment person in there not too many other people trying to fill that void

152
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,935
So I talked to this professor Ed Larson

153
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:18,591
Who considers himself a 20th Amendment man absolutely correct and it's like kind of hard to get people up in the morning

154
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
For like structure

155
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
Changes I guess

156
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,247
The Bill of Rights might be a little bit more sexy for lack of a better word but

157
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:31,647
Well it got me up this morning it can get people up but it takes more explained

158
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,719
As unsexy as the 20th Amendment might seem

159
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
It was past

160
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
Thanks in large part

161
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
To a very sexy

President hotel room with his mistress when he got word that he just getting the nomination

163

Warren Gamaliel Harding

165
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:56,735
Warren G Harding 29th president of the United States has become fat

166
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
Famous for his

167
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,295
Femi infidelity

168
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,879
And his failures as a present

169
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:09,535
Hi there very few supporters

170
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,631
General consensus among historians and political sciences to both parties

171
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Is

172
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Harding

173
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
Define

174
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
The bottom

175
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,543
Pardon himself famously said

176
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
I am not fit for this office

177
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
And should never have been here

178
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,479
A modest man who had a lot of reason to be modest

179
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,039
He wasn't exactly an ideas guy

180
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,599
The Republican Party chose him as a compromise

181
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:39,999
He would be a tool of the special interest in it to all of the members of Congress to to love the people picking him

182
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,327
It turns out generally kind of a tool

183
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,727
And this one episode in President Harding's presidency was unpopular enough

184
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:56,127
Reddit Inspire the country to change something pretty fundamental about the way things ran

185
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,175
The old system was set up

186
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
Almost

187
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
By accident

188
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
It was an accident

189
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Timing

190
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,831
Since the founding of the nation

191
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,391
Our government ran on a very strange

192
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,463
Elections would happen in November

193
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Like they do now

194
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,071
But new readers wouldn't take office until way later

195
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
Presidents

196
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,119
Started their terms

197
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
5 whole month

198
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
After they were like

199
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
And Congress

200
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,287
The new Congress didn't first meet for a year

201
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,663
Is created a strange phenomenon

202
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,479
Where anytime of Congress is elected

203
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,015
The old Congress

204
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,575
Lame duck congress

205
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
They call it

206
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,159
That had been potentially voted out by

207
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,975
Those guys got to meet

208
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
Bro whole session

209
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,351
A whole session where they didn't have to answer to the p

210
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,935
You ask why why would such an

211
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
Obvious

212
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
Anomaly not be correct

213
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
The reason is it's why other a logical

214
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,383
Constitution Amendments don't get past

215
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
The lame-duck

216
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
The lane.

217
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
Game from the

218
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,599
The lame Ducks game because they basically had an entire session of Congress

219
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,391
Where they were free to do what they wanted

220
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
And because

221
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,231
Every member of Congress views themselves

222
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,767
What is a potential lame duck

223
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
They all are going to retire or lose some time

224
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,399
You could never get enough of them

225
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,679
To vote for the amendment

226
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
That is until

227
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
This one

228
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
Shameful

229
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
Shameful

230
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
Episode

231
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,871
Under Warren G Harding

232
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
Bucs backup

233
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,791
President Harding ran on

234
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
2 catchphrase

235
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,863
I invented a new word

236
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
Normal

237
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
Return to normalcy

238
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,751
Whatever normalcy is we're going to return to it

239
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
And right after World War II

240
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,151
That was a popular idea

241
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
.

242
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Vision

243
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,223
When America was

244
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
Was great

245
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
He wanted to

246
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
Bring that

247
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
The other was

248
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
America first

249
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
America first

250
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,487
Stabilize America

251
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,559
Prosper America

252
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
Bank of America

253
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,167
He called for

254
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:32,031
Isolationism breaking relations with our traditional allies in Europe

255
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
Getting rid of immigrants

256
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
I know you're thinking

257
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
The push to immigration

258
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,711
Legislation that became law that for the first time

259
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
Excluded

260
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,295
People from America based on the

261
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,575
Source of where they came from

262
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,903
Southern Europe in Eastern Europe totally barring people from Asia

263
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,207
Of course barring people from places like Africa

264
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
And the

265
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,303
Pills for a return to normalcy

266
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
Play Ed America first

267
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,143
Had tremendous residence

268
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
In 1920

269
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
By 1922

270
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,031
His second year in office

271
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,567
Wasn't quite so

272
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,359
Sure because you had a back way

273
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,943
And the midterm elections of 1922

274
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,503
Where a landslide against

275
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
Harding and the

276
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,319
Looking party the Democrats

277
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
Gained

278
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
84 seats

279
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
It's a huge wave election

280
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:27,071
It was one of the biggest losses for a sitting president's party that the House of Representatives had ever seen

281
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
Just for contrast

282
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,911
The latest midterm swing in the house

283
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
Was roughly the

284
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
20th largest in his

285
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
This one was the

286
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
Fourth largest

287
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Boston history

288
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
And yet

289
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,639
At the time when you did have a wave election

290
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,431
When one party

291
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,759
What's power the other party hung around

292
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,927
In control of Congress

293
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:59,327
Passing all sorts of bills that were against the will of the people

294
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:05,727
I understand that like 4-year for like the first hundred fifty years of the democracy

295
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:12,127
Half the time Congress had the potential to be completely undemocratic right is that

296
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:18,527
Fair assessment I guess people wouldn't have called it a democracy back then I was some sort of republic

297
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,463
But the audacity of Warren Harding's next me

298
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,119
The corrupt bill that he tried to get past

299
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,911
During the lame duck

300
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:39,519
Session of 1922 most notorious one was his

301
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
Ship's Bell

302
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,359
Built to build ships

303
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,199
For the Merchant Marine that would

304
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Prophet

305
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,271
Republican donors and his friends

306
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
Mightily

307
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,831
It woke a lot of people up

308
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,135
Both Republicans and Democrats

309
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,927
Do the problems with lame duck

310
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,487
Also there were widespread rumors

311
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,535
That he was promising jobs

312
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
Two lame duck members of Congress

313
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
Who Woulda

314
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,983
Vote his way

315
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
President Harding

316
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,567
Didn't end up getting his way

317
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,639
One of the most famous filibusters in history

318
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
Stop the show

319
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
Ship's Bell

320
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
And

321
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,759
The widespread outcry against the corruption

322
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,295
Launch the campaign

323
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,319
That would end

324
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,647
With the following Amendment to the US Constitution

325
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,927
Read for us now

326
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
Buy actor Jeffrey Wright

327
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
20th Amendment

328
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
Presidential tournaments

329
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
Succession

330
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
Assembly of Congress

331
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,143
The terms of the president and the vice

332
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,703
Didn't show end at noon on the twentieth day of January

333
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,823
And the terms of senators and representatives at noon on the 3rd day of January

334
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,919
The years in which such terms would have ended if this article and not been writing

335
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
And the terms of theirs

336
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,503
Successors shall then begin

337
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
Baby.

338
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,319
Did that fix it

339
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
Well

340
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,903
What did the 20th Amendment solve

341
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
Lame duck problems

342
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
So we still have a legacy

343
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:09,631
Not completely in the short lame duck. It's no longer a lame duck session

344
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:16,031
It's shorter now but we do have a period when the old office holders can't

345
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,055
Continue to hold power

346
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:23,455
And that gets criticized because that old Congress if it loses power will suddenly confirm about

347
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:29,855
Bunch of Judges or pass a bunch of laws or the president will issue a bunch of Pardons or or dual hose

348
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,647
Fluid last minute regulations

349
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,695
That's still a legacy

350
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:40,095
That wasn't changed by the 20th Amendment because the 20th Amendment itself like everything else in the mirror

351
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,655
American in the constitution is a compromise

352
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,799
Julia Longoria with that liner note for the 20th Amendment

353
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
The artist

354
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,151
That tackled the 20th on the most perfect album

355
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:58,783
Is Virginia rapper R&B singer Huey Supreme Samantha's going in on his project was

356
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,111
I thought it was a

357
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
Cuz

358
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
It's vital

359
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,951
That people have to

360
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,023
Black people importantly but everybody really

361
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,399
Need to know their constitutional rights especially in today's climate on my thoughts going into the song as I had the 20th Amendment

362
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,983
And on this a bunch of different sections to this amendment

363
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,311
Interesting to see how would I type

364
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,847
And

365
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,663
The way I posted is I I posted from

366
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,455
From the perspective of

367
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:33,855
The actual person as if I was in Congress myself

368
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:59,455
But I can't stop yet

369
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,855
Men In Black II

370
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:11,487
What I like what the song is it Huey spring rights in perspective somebody who's lost

371
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,023
Maybe an election who knows

372
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,631
There in that lined up. But they that they they decide

373
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,423
Not to be opportunistic about it

374
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,727
Because the work

375
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,775
He's way more important than they are

376
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,823
And so they just want to do good

377
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,103
Switzer flips it

378
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,407
Tell me more about like somebody who's

379
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,943
Faithful Inn

380
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:37,343
Selfless

381
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:43,743
I pray that I don't

382
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,863
Get here the whole song at the most perfect album. Org

383
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,959
Anjana barad we will continue in a moment

384
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,663
I'm Jedi boom Rod this is the most perfect album we've done 20 we've done 12

385
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,967
One more to go 17th Amendment

386
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,759
Popular election of senators

387
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:12,415
This song

388
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:17,791
I mean it is about the 17th Amendment

389
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,095
The one and only amendment that creep

390
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
Senators being

391
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:27,775
Voted in

392
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:37,759
So on chill while recording the song I wrote most of the lyrics during a cartoon that will pop up if you Google

393
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:44,159
17th Amendment

394
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:48,255
Okay so a little background that is

395
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,559
Indie rocker singer-songwriter person

396
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,583
Stef chura

397
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,191
Chose to write a song about the 17th Amendment

398
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
That is an amendment

399
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
And she write about

400
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
Lyrics

401
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
That

402
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,311
Melissa Lee tries to

403
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,615
Stamp Out undue influence

404
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
From

405
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
Special interest

406
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
Appraise Yukons

407
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,735
Your politicians say drain the swamp

408
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
Special interest

409
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,783
No more special interest

410
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,831
Well

411
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
I didn't know this

412
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
The back in the day

413
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,928
We the citizens of America

414
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,488
Did not choose our Senators directly

415
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,768
State Legislature

416
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,792
Would choose them

417
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,560
For us

418
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,096
That open the door

419
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,888
For those special interest

420
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,192
To walk in and essentially by power

421
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
You had a big

422
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,032
Oil companies big coal companies all kinds of become

423
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,592
Making these backroom deals with

424
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:39,200
Legislators to get whoever they wanted elected and the 17th Amendment

425
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:46,880
Made the electing of senators way more Democrat

426
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,048
Stop this song goes out to my senators

427
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,864
And the choice that we get in

428
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,240
Yeah so thank you

429
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,520
This was a pleasure

430
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:13,760
You can hear Steph Curry entire song at the most perfect album. Org

431
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,088
The Senate of the United States shall be composed

432
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,880
The two senators from each state

433
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,696
Elected by the people thereof

434
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
For 6 years

435
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,624
Producer Julia Longoria hit it so

436
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,416
Crazy story

437
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:56,000
For the first hundred fifty years of our democracy

438
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,024
The people

439
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,816
Did not vote for

440
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
Our senator

441
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:08,032
Nope that's so yeah the 17th Amendment change that it made things more democratic

442
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,568
And frankly

443
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:15,968
This seems like a very boring Amendment and I feel like we should move right along because there's really nothing to see here you're right

444
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,808
Most people don't go around thinking about the 17th Amendment and kind of like

445
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
You know

446
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:26,208
Burning with the desire to have their state legislatures appoint senators

447
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,256
Yeah but

448
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,840
That desire did burn in the heart of

449
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
This man

450
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
Yes

451
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:37,216
My name is John Daniel Davidson I'm a senior correspondent at the Federalist

452
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,544
The Federalist is a conservative online magazine

453
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,848
I'm John DD has written in it

454
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,872
About the needs

455
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
Rethink the 17

456
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,968
And maybe go back to the way things were

457
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,296
Where state legislators would choose our Senators for

458
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,344
It's an idea.

459
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,392
Firstcut flame in his heart

460
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,928
On a long drive

461
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
What he says

462
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,256
He saw democracy at work

463
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,584
So I went to Alabama and I drove around the state

464
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,400
Going to a lot of different small towns

465
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,680
And talking with

466
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,240
Baptist Churches white working-class people

467
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:15,872
The state was in the middle of a special election to replace their senator

468
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:21,248
As I spoke to these people the number one thing that came through

469
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,784
Was that they felt

470
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,552
As though

471
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,832
Federal government

472
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,624
Did not represent them

473
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,696
And did not represent their values and that they had no voice

474
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:33,024
They felt like American democracy was being rigged

475
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
Bye

476
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
Wait for it

477
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,840
Special interest

478
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:40,704
At the time there was one candidate who spoke directly to that feeling

479
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,728
His big message

480
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:47,360
I do care about you I am like you I will represent you and not the special interests

481
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,944
That control Washington when he put it like that it sounds

482
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
Kind of

483
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:58,368
Romantic though I mean so you like a psycho I'm going to absolutely it sounds romantic

484
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:02,464
And until you end up with candidates like Roy Moore

485
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,864
Let's break it down a total of 9 women has now come forward with allegations of overtures by Roy Moore

486
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,960
Is a 14 year old

487
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,008
Girl

488
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,312
Moore is a pedophile

489
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:22,176
Right and that's when the reality kind of comes crashing in

490
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
That

491
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
That

492
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,784
You do need to temper the will of the people

493
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,832
How to direct it in positive drug

494
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,672
Letter words maybe the people

495
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,280
Don't always know best

496
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
Maybe

497
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,864
And this is something here a lot these days

498
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,912
Maybe democracy

499
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,448
Is not all it's cracked up to

500
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,240
We do not have a democracy

501
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
Established by the

502
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:54,688
That's Todd's a Wiki one of the first people who called for the repeal of the 17th Amendment would you say that you worried like the fan

503
00:25:54,944 --> 00:26:01,088
Founder of this movement refers to a bit of an overstatement called a movement

504
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,392
This is fun

505
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,696
He has no fantasies about

506
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,000
Xvii actually being repealed

507
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,560
But he thinks it's a worthy thought

508
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
Experiment is it fair to say that

509
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,400
You kind of want to send it to look a little bit more like this

510
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,168
Supreme Court

511
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,216
Well I think that's what the framers had in mind

512
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,032
That people who served in the Senate

513
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:20,800
It would be

514
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,848
People who weren't really going to

515
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
Stupid

516
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Scrabble

517
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,664
Provokes the way that

518
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
Back the house of

519
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
To do it

520
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,552
Tod's argument sort of mirrors with a lot of the founders

521
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,832
Way back in the beginning

522
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
We're scared of

523
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,416
Hamilton Madison Adams

524
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:40,512
When they're big fears was that the people don't always know best

525
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,584
That democracy is good but it's not everything

526
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,120
Cuz what ends up working with

527
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,912
People is sometimes rhetoric

528
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
Stooping it

529
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,496
Scrabbling and telling people what they want to hear

530
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,312
Path argument is that we need a vetted group of people

531
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
To take the Senate

532
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,384
I don't mean senators are smarter

533
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,408
More independent

534
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
More thoughtful

535
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:01,760
I wanted to ask you these people that you talk to

536
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,320
Did they convince you any

537
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:11,232
Give me more reason to pause than I thought they would actually historian Nancy Unger

538
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
Team demak

539
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
Can you give me like the

540
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,560
Hatchiyack

541
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,888
Radio jingle version of the argument for the 17th Amendment

542
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:22,752
And like why we shouldn't curtail the people's right to basically shoot ourselves in the foot

543
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:26,336
I would probably have to give you Robert LaFollette quote

544
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,920
The Supreme issue involved in all the others

545
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:34,272
Is the encroachment of the powerful few upon the rights of the many

546
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,576
Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue

547
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,416
But we'll take it

548
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,768
Nancy argue

549
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,560
You kind of got to pick your poison

550
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,888
Like on the one hand world without the 17th Amendment

551
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,448
We kind of already know what that looks like

552
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,240
Anybody can do a Google search

553
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:02,688
And look at some of the cartoons from the Gilded Age and Progressive Era those are the periods right before

554
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
For the 17th with

555
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,064
And there's a very famous one of all the senators in the Senate

556
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,136
But behind them are the real bosses of the Senate

557
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,184
And huge money bags

558
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,256
You know senators were essentially being

559
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,096
Bought and sold now money-in-politics obviously

560
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
Still an issue

561
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
It's not uncheck

562
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:26,240
The way that it really was I believe prior to the Seventeenth Amendment

563
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,056
So that's one reality

564
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,152
Balanced against that you have

565
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,688
The current

566
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,712
Where you get

567
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,504
The Roy Moore's of the world

568
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:44,928
And it seems like we the people have this tendency sometimes to take out the proverbial gun

569
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
Polish it

570
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,744
When it right down at our foot

571
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,632
I think that is a problem but for me it's the lesser of two evils

572
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,472
Nancy thinks back to those Progressive lawmaker

573
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
Curse who

574
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,288
First made the 17th Amendment happen

575
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Bear moment

576
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,592
Was this

577
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,872
Real belief

578
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,408
In the power of the people

579
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:11,808
It's progressives you don't love these people were being with live during the Civil War they remembered Abraham Lincoln they really

580
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
Believe

581
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
That you could trust

582
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:17,184
The people in power them and they would use that power

583
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,952
For good

584
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,144
That says a lot about their moment and I think the idea of repealing it now says a certain

585
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,424
Amount about our moment

586
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
There are risks

587
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,472
In democracy

588
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,104
I just don't think that we have the right to expect that everything is going to be simple or it's going to be perfect

589
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,152
The deeply

590
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,200
Frustrating thing about democracy

591
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,784
But also the deeply beautiful thing about it

592
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,624
Is a every decision is only here for

593
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
Every bad decision

594
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,256
And also every good decision you know you're never done

595
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,560
You're always working you're always

596
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:59,680
Developing you have to fight for democracy every generation has to fight for it in a new way

597
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,392
Next week will have the final episode of

598
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,952
This season final two amendments look out for that

599
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,512
