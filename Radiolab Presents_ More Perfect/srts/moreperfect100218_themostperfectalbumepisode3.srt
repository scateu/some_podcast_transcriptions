1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:05,888
WNYC Studios

2
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:59,136
This is more perfect season 3 that right

3
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,672
Are we hearing are the kominas

4
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,792
A South Asian American punk band that chose the 9th Amendment

5
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,120
Give me the whole song at the most perfect album. Org

6
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,264
We have released an album as I have mentioned in the past two episodes were really excited we made this album called 27 the most

7
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,288
Perfect album

8
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,592
We asked a bunch of musicians

9
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,360
2

10
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,408
Write a song that interpret

11
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,480
One of the amendments to the US Constitution

12
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,760
Bunch of different artists

13
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:29,344
Participated again canoe the whole thing at the most perfect album. Org

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,392
We're on iTunes Spotify all the stuff

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928
On the podcast

16
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,976
We are

17
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,768
Releasing what I like to think of it

18
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,304
Is audio liner notes

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,584
Tucson

20
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,680
The short little stories that illuminate some aspect of the amendment

21
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216
Now the first 8 amendments

22
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,752
We're very clear

23
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
Right to free speech

24
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,080
Right to bear arms

25
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,128
3rd Amendment

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
Whatever

27
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,200
But then you know you get to the amendments

28
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,272
Talk about the rights you have when you are arrested by the police

29
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,576
Superman effect concrete

30
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
But then

31
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
Things get Spacey

32
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
Unhinged

33
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
Untethered

34
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,376
Especially when you get to the next three 9th Amendment

35
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,400
10th Amendment

36
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
11th dimension

37
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,728
This tremendous

38
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
A little bit trippy

39
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:32,832
Not to say they're not important some people would argue they're the most important amendments but it's just that they're very hard to understand by Joe

40
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
Reading the text

41
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,696
Can I have to talk about them by talking about something else

42
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
That makes me sad

43
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,768
So that's what we're going to do

44
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
Play the songs

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,584
Second for the moment

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,144
The liner notes we're trying use metaphor

47
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
To bring these

48
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
Spacey amendments

49
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
Back down to earth

50
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
Starting with

51
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
9th Amendment

52
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,592
The Knights Inn on enumerated rights retained by P

53
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,176
The enumeration in the Constitution

54
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
Of certain rights

55
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,552
Shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people

56
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
Yeah

57
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,952
Listen to one more option in the constitution of certain rights

58
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,560
Shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people

59
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,376
So I've been reading about the 9th Amendment

60
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,704
More perfect producer and learning the basically

61
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,288
The reason it's around is because the framers wanted to cover their asses

62
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,200
Basically the 9th looks back at the previous eight amendments and it says

63
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,296
Deserve rights but they are only rights

64
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,344
You got way more rights than that

65
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
Pictures aren't written down

66
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,696
Which I guess makes sense but

67
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
Does it

68
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
I mean

69
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,328
We can pretty much choose to do anything that isn't illegal

70
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,376
But there are lots of things aren't

71
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,424
Constitutional guarantees

72
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
I mean

73
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
Mckown

74
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:59,104
If we have boundless 9th Amendment rights why don't we have a guaranteed right to marijuana

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,152
Are free refills window seats

76
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:06,784
The right the complimentary dinner mints the right to tasting tiny pieces of candy out of those bulk container right.

77
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
Ice cream for breakfast

78
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,416
Everyday it's just like it's super vague and I

79
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:18,047
Wanted to know how to understand it better so I started Googling whatever I could

80
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,095
And I came across a professor

81
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:25,727
This is Judith bear from Texas A&M University political science

82
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:30,079
And I specialize in public law and you just told me about a case

83
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,895
Call Griswold versus Connecticut

84
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,295
The story of Griswold vs Connecticut begins in 1961

85
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,647
Okay Estelle Griswold was the executive director

86
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,975
Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut

87
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:52,095
Still got together with a Yale med school gynecologist named Sealy Buxton

88
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,935
Started a clinic in New Haven

89
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,287
Popular in the community they had lots of clients

90
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,871
And within ten days the police shut them down

91
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:12,575
Because keep in mind this was before Roe v Wade and in Connecticut in the mid-60s

92
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,159
The use of any

93
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Contraception

94
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,583
It was illegal to even use birth control so it was super illegal to start a clinic where you coach women

95
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
In married couples about it

96
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:31,263
But it's all Griswold was doing it anyway I think it's very evident unenforceable

97
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,823
I think if you had a policeman under every bed

98
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,223
In the state of Connecticut they still could not prove anything this is tape of Estelle Griswold from that time

99
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
Continuing

100
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
Baby illegally

101
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
But we are continuing our program

102
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,671
So in the late fall of 1961

103
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,719
We issue two warrants

104
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:57,375
One against Estelle Griswold and the other against dr. Seely Buxton

105
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,911
Buxton are arrested

106
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,239
In violation of the contraceptive statue

107
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
What happens next

108
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
Is the clinic at shuttered

109
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
They go to court

110
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,711
The case makes it all the way up to the Supreme Court

111
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,759
And eventually they win in a way

112
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,551
The field was very obvious

113
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,087
An incredibly odd

114
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
Also like

115
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,463
Somewhat metaphysical in the opinion

116
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,303
William O Douglas the Justice who wrote for the court

117
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:31,167
Wrote the various guarantees create zones of privacy

118
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,983
Amendments here the first

119
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,287
3rd the 4th and 9th V

120
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:41,663
Saying they all guarantee privacy and if a woman wants use birth control in her own home

121
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,711
Are privacy there should be protected

122
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,247
Privacy is important

123
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
Got it

124
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
But

125
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,623
Things get weird when you realize the word privacy

126
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,463
And is privacy mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. Absolutely not

127
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,511
Is nowhere to be found

128
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:02,143
The actual word privacy is written exactly zero times in the US Constitution

129
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,471
We all believe that we do in fact have that right

130
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
What to make of this

131
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
Well

132
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:13,151
In the Griswold case Douglas offers the following explanation Douglas

133
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,039
That certain constitutional guarantees have the numbers

134
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,623
Formed by emanations

135
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
From these right

136
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,839
Snake gives them light and substance

137
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,423
Numbers combinations light

138
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Substance

139
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
It's so it almost sounds like

140
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,591
I'm just so captivated because it just

141
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:47,455
It sounds so physical it doesn't sound that high-level law it's like

142
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
Penumbra

143
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,807
Comes from two Latin words

144
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,855
Meaning gear

145
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,879
Shadow

146
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:59,743
So you're using a metaphor from the natural world

147
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,303
To describe an idea

148
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:08,959
Justice William O Douglas said the all our constitutional rights have penumbra's of emanation stretching out into space

149
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
Imagine

150
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,567
An exploding star

151
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:20,479
A supernova this glowing white ball with light radiating out in every direction into the Vas

152
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,319
Space

153
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:30,463
So according to him while the law doesn't say anything about privacy explicitly

154
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
Pepsi is kind of

155
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,839
Contained in the space that

156
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,375
The law emanates

157
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
Into

158
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
Something

159
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
Hello

160
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
Hello the soccer cup

161
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,615
It is and I'm going to take you off on speakerphone

162
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
I think I'm going to take you off this

163
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
Speakerphone

164
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,991
Why did they go

165
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
Where is it

166
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:58,623
Idea that we can understand the 9th Amendment through

167
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
Cosmic metaphor

168
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,535
Now that's so beautiful weird

169
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:11,423
Headset no so vague like everytime I really try and wrap my head around it it's just

170
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,983
No I think you're still in doubt

171
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
And so

172
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,103
I thought maybe I just need to understand what a penumbra actually

173
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
Is

174
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,199
So I called the guy who knows

175
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:29,599
Hello yes I'm on speakers no longer we do not understand how that happened it is strictly magical

176
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
Probably in a

177
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,183
Black hole vortex

178
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,535
This is dr. Ed cropp director of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles

179
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:44,191
Doctor cup is an astronomer knows a lot about the numbers so I asked him for a definition Umbra

180
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,471
Is a Zone

181
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,007
Eyeshadow out

182
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,079
Side of the main Central shadow

183
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,871
That is cast by

184
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,431
A Celestial light like the

185
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
The Sun

186
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,295
Think about a solar eclipse where the Moon is casting a shadow on the Earth

187
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,599
The deep dark center part of that

188
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
Shadow is called

189
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:09,279
The Umbra and the penumbra is the less dark outer fuzzy edge of that shadow where

190
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
What is deep

191
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,119
So kind of like the furry shadow on the edge of a dark shadow

192
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
A little

193
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:21,567
My suspicion is that you've probably not seen a total solar eclipse that correct

194
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,919
Last year doesn't count feels like it counts

195
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,503
The the fact okay whatever

196
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:34,111
I asked him based on his understanding of the numbers and astronomy

197
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:40,511
What do you think Douglass meant when he said certain constitutional guarantees have

198
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,607
Penumbra's formed by emanations

199
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
From these right

200
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,543
Give them light and substance like does that make sense to him as an astronomer

201
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,895
No no no no no

202
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:03,039
Night I certainly understand how you're saying about the love but that's a different thing than the actual

203
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,575
Experience of the penumbra

204
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:10,719
So sure if you want to think about it if it's the law if it's a light source it would emanate

205
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
Light

206
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
Which

207
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,327
Could create a shadow but the shadow doesn't

208
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
Give the light

209
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
It's light in substance

210
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
It already

211
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
How's the light

212
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
Inside of it

213
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
And

214
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,871
You know it's it's

215
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
Difficult

216
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,455
For me to

217
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
Endorse

218
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:39,391
That that that analogy

219
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
Douglas

220
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
What did you mean

221
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,535
Does it surprise you that

222
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
His metaphor doesn't hold up

223
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,143
No not at all

224
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,727
This is David J Garrow

225
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
Missy in the making of Roe v Wade

226
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:00,127
And he's written a lot about Justice Douglas Juvenile Justice Douglas reputation

227
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,687
Pulling these Concepts

228
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,503
Out of the air almost literally out of

229
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,271
The astronaut

230
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
Glare

231
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,599
Unfortunately that was par for the course

232
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
With Justice.

233
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,231
Yeah. You Tatian for being a brilliant legal mind but

234
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,767
Also kind of a jerk

235
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,583
Not to mention a womanizer and

236
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
Kind of lazy

237
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,935
His former clerk said his opinions were quote

238
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,215
Drafted in 20 minutes

239
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
Easy to ignore

240
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,335
Is another quote here that they were superficial or just plain sloppy like that

241
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,895
Strong is almost unprecedented

242
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
For a justices

243
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
Former Clerk

244
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
Speak

245
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Critically

246
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
Highly critical

247
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,575
Of the just

248
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
Subsequent

249
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
Public

250
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,511
Thanks

251
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,815
Seriously Justice Douglas you can't

252
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
Put in a little effort here

253
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,911
I guess another question attached that buddy

254
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
Do you kind of

255
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,471
Yelled at like does it feel short

256
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,775
For example it's been reported

257
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,079
The Justice Clarence Thomas

258
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
I had a

259
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,615
Sign in

260
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,431
Is Chambers at the Supreme Court saying

261
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,479
Please don't emanate in the penumbra

262
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,767
All that sad when I when I hold all of this in my hands the unenumerated rights

263
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,815
Penumbra the moon all of it

264
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,351
I feel like maybe Douglas

265
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
Was destined to fail

266
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
Tonight's amendment is different

267
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:34,847
I'm like the first eight amendments to outline and incredible detail what Americans should ask

268
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
Of their new government

269
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:43,039
The 9th Amendment comes floating and without astronomical Vibes gesturing dreamily all the uncontainable

270
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,319
Indomitable rights

271
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,415
To which Americans can lay claim without ever being able to point them in text

272
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,487
The founders of this country one of the things

273
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,767
They had in mind

274
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,607
What's the law wasn't just a set of words or a set of rules

275
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
The law had a spirit

276
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
Ever the spirit of the law

277
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,007
And that there was something behind those words

278
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,031
That you couldn't

279
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,567
Put your finger on

280
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
Couldn't exactly name

281
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,455
Maybe Douglas failed because he was lazy

282
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,271
Maybe he failed because he had to

283
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
Maybe it's failure

284
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
Is the whole point

285
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:26,303
Kelly Prime did that audio liner note for the night

286
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,703
Bennett

287
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
Ride Along

288
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
10th Amendment

289
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:13,151
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution

290
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,455
Nor prohibited by it to the states

291
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,527
Are reserved to the states respectively

292
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
What do the people

293
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,159
This is often called the states rights

294
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
I'm in it

295
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,023
And the history behind it

296
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
In Tuscaloosa

297
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
Very hot

298
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Nearly 100

299
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
It's pretty dark

300
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,935
70 years ago states rights

301
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
Swerve

302
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
Repeatedly invoked

303
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,543
To say

304
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,943
Segregation tomorrow segregation forever

305
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,735
Cannot mandate

306
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,527
Quality because we have a right to regulate

307
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
Play in this area

308
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,319
That's the ugliest

309
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
According to Heather Gerken

310
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
Dean of Yale law school but

311
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,439
She says it's not the present

312
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:03,839
Do you want to see where has most of the workmen going on

313
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:10,239
1 State however has Doug and it's healed

314
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,639
Mental reform where has the most work been going on

315
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,479
Moving forward lgbtq issues

316
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:24,831
That's what happened at the state and local level and that definitely predates the Trump Administration

317
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
Two states rights

318
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,287
This Tenth Amendment idea

319
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Cuts both ways

320
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,919
And maybe the deeper point is that

321
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,759
Yeah this push and pull between the federal government and the states

322
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
It's fundamental

323
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
To the way the country was built

324
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
Heart of the app

325
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
Fundamental architecture

326
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,303
Sir like if you go to DC and

327
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,119
Is Capitol Building look up at the curve Dome

328
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,703
In a basic Dome what you have is the wait

329
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
Of the Dome itself

330
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,543
Immense radial Force

331
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,847
Pushing out away from the center

332
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,151
Down against the stone walls

333
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,199
The stonewalls resistant push back up

334
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,271
And the only reason the thing doesn't fall on your head

335
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,599
It's because of those inner forces pushing against each other

336
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,231
To go slightly farther feel there's a concept in architecture called 10 Segway

337
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,839
With the Integrity of the structure is the tension itself that's what holds it up

338
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,679
10th Amendment

339
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,471
Is evidence that the founders

340
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,495
This country had

341
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,311
Something like that in mind I mean these guys were builders

342
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,591
Washington

343
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,431
Jefferson they were on and on about designing their own homes

344
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,991
And the Republic

345
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,271
Did they design for us

346
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,063
Is built

347
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
On forces

348
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
Colliding

349
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Forces

350
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
Any kind of balanced tension

351
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
That's

352
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,023
Kind of what the tenth amendment is all about

353
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
Okay

354
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,863
I think we should all be here

355
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
Cool

356
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,167
Everybody

357
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:19,007
Emily Rick

358
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:25,407
Big to meet you guys thank you so much for that song it's so amazing I guess first would you mind

359
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:30,015
Introducing yourself this is Rick Alverson

360
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Pennsylvania

361
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:38,207
Bentley near Chest 10th Amendment

362
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:44,607
Facebook Kelly Prime in studio

363
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:51,007
We are an excerpt

364
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:10,207
Can you tell me a little bit about the process

365
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:16,351
The writing the song like if you were to paint a picture of look what idea came to you first

366
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,887
We live in Virginia

367
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,935
In Richmond Virginia and the

368
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,031
The idea of states rights is very volatile

369
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,823
Idea here

370
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:30,175
I think we were thinking of the idea of the individual versus the collective and

371
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,271
Eternal struggle in the American

372
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,807
Brand of democracy

373
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
I think it was

374
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,391
Envisioning

375
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:47,583
Legal historical struggle might look like in the context of a relationship

376
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:52,959
What an individual bring to a relationship and how an individual

377
00:19:54,239 --> 00:20:00,383
How they identify as a couple

378
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:13,951
What year we put it into me

379
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:20,351
I vs. we dynamic

380
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:33,151
You can be a beneficial friction or it can be a problematic volatile sort of thing you know

381
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,943
I think that we are

382
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:42,623
I mean just so increasingly divided and polarized

383
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,927
All of the new on

384
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,511
Out of a conversation

385
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,095
In a way that

386
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:58,495
This doesn't really allow us to hold a space for being individuals and being a collective at the same time

387
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:05,151
In a way that doesn't feel

388
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,760
That was a song by the band linear

389
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,552
Love that song written

390
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,576
10th Amendment

391
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
Farrar album

392
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,416
Call 27 the most perfect album

393
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,464
You can listen to the full song

394
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,256
All the songs in their entirety at

395
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
At the most perfect album.

396
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,864
I'm Chad album Rod this is more perfect

397
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
I'll be back in a moment

398
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:08,128
Caged add more perfect we're marching through the Amendments listing two excerpts

399
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,176
Songs inspired by these amendments

400
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
27 most

401
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,528
Perfect album and we're telling stories about the Amendments we've done 9

402
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
Buju Banton

403
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
Now

404
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,600
11th Amendment

405
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
Suits against States

406
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:26,304
The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity

407
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:31,424
Commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state

408
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,496
For by citizens or subjects of any foreign state

409
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,848
Okay so this is another amendment

410
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
That's

411
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,408
Little hard to park

412
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,552
I mean technically says he listened to it

413
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
Did you get your power

414
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,392
Or the United States something

415
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,976
About how a person who lives in one state

416
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:55,744
One of the United

417
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,304
By Steelix a Georgia I don't know

418
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,096
Natsu

419
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
Barnes day

420
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
A difference day

421
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,704
To someone who lives in Georgia

422
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,496
Can't sue the state

423
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
Florida

424
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
That's

425
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,592
Basically what

426
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,688
I mean it gets more complicated way more complicated but at its base

427
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:18,784
It's this wonky little Rule and it says the 11th Amendment

428
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:22,112
I've got the Bill of Rights which is one through 10 and

429
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,392
Spilled with these Blockbuster

430
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,928
The right to free speech

431
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
The right to bear arms

432
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
The right

433
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
2A

434
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,328
Trial by jury of your peers and then you get this

435
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
Why

436
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,448
Can't answer

437
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,752
At least come up with a satisfying

438
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
It helps

439
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,336
To Free Your Mind

440
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,104
The literal

441
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,176
Here's Julia Longoria

442
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
It seems

443
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,784
To me that the 11th Amendment is hugely

444
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,112
Complicated and difficult to teach even in law schools

445
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:58,208
Yes I spend several weeks on it in a minute Advanced upper-class course

446
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,864
But Susanna Sharia professor at Vanderbilt law so we have the unenviable challenge

447
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:11,264
Trying to package this in like a 3 to 5 minutes

448
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,664
Little tap dancing so general public so

449
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,688
The metaphor that I

450
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,224
You could have tried

451
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,504
Is it

452
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,296
Seems maybe like it

453
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
The appendix

454
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,744
Of the gothic Constitution where body is the appendix not too bad

455
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,680
I woke up one morning feeling just a little bit queasy and nauseous. Maybe I had eaten something

456
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,240
Dr. Heather Smith

457
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,776
Is an anatomy professor

458
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,336
And she was first introduced to her appendix

459
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,872
When she was 12 years old

460
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
When it hurts

461
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,064
Like the discomfort became more and more localized into the lower part of my right abdomen

462
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,440
And by the end of the day that day I was in the emergency room having my appendix removed

463
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,256
This is how a lot of us encounter the append

464
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,792
On its way out

465
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,864
And if you look at a picture of the appendix it looks like this

466
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
Weird

467
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,680
Long wart

468
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,960
Coming out of our large

469
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,520
Darwin when he look today

470
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:19,872
Call the vestigial organ evolutionary remnant

471
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
Say something that

472
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,224
Was useful in the past that is no longer useful

473
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,784
Darwin's hypothesis was that

474
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,344
Nr8 ancestors

475
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,880
They were much more folivora

476
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,672
Brass meaning that they ate a lot more

477
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:39,072
Grasses leaves and silver climbing up trees and eating leaves and branches then you just special

478
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:44,704
Enzymes and their body to digest that stuff those enzymes were stored in the appendix area

479
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
At least that's what the

480
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,800
But then over time

481
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
Are diet

482
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,616
So his hypothesis was

483
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,944
That are large intestines essentially shrunk in size

484
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,784
And that when they Shrunk the appendix trunk along with them

485
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,856
So the theory is that now it's just this

486
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:05,952
Depleted useless organ past its prime that does nothing but

487
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
Cod problem

488
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:12,096
And for some people it's tempting to see the 11th Amendment in kind of the same way

489
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,656
Where was once the super crucial thing

490
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,680
And now

491
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,448
It causes pain

492
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,240
Are you saying it was crucial one point

493
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,288
Yeah actually went why

494
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Well

495
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,616
You have to remember this amendment was drafted

496
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,920
Originally in 1793

497
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,064
Bats Bradford Clark a law professor from George Washington University

498
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,344
So only

499
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
4 years after the

500
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,184
Tution was adopted and only 2 years after

501
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
The Bill of Rights

502
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:43,328
Keep in mind the country is a baby at this point like it's a newborn

503
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,704
And so most of the people who wrote the founding document had actually recently

504
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,008
Ben British ends in Britain

505
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:56,128
There was this idea that you can't sue The King The King has a dignity

506
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,712
That would be affronted if he were

507
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,528
Dragged into court by a comment

508
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,832
And the founders of the United States

509
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,160
They took that same idea and put it into the US

510
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,720
Most people took for granted

511
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,536
But the federal government would be immune from suit

512
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,328
But it didn't seem like the states

513
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,864
We're going to get that seem immunity

514
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,168
And seats were like

515
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
We're not signing on to the concert

516
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,752
Institution if we don't get that immunity

517
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,824
B2 maybe it's hard for us in this modern

518
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
World

519
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,616
To put ourselves back

520
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,920
Into the mindset of the people

521
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,224
At the time but I think the states

522
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,504
Burberry

523
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
Proud

524
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
Of winning their independence

525
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,624
So in the Declaration of Independence

526
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,416
They declared themselves

527
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
To be

528
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,976
Free and independent

529
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
States

530
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,560
We don't think of this today but the word state

531
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,888
What's the word that was used in international law

532
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,912
To describe

533
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,192
A Sovereign Nation

534
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,752
And it's still used that way in other countries

535
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:58,080
And one of the prerogatives of sovereign states

536
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,384
What's not to be sued

537
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,456
In its own courts or in the courts of another sovereign

538
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
Without its

539
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
Consent

540
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,784
And so that was the basic idea

541
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,344
Dates were never going to give up immunity

542
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,672
They would never sign on to the Constitution without it

543
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,768
So in some ways the 11th Amendment kind of Saved our concert

544
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
Esthetician

545
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
The states wouldn't be forced to

546
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
The payback.

547
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,120
I thought they were not people

548
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,912
And because of that

549
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:27,264
The country could continue to exist until that was very important back then

550
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,312
I don't think we worry about that

551
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
Very much

552
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:30,848
Now

553
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:38,784
These days according to Suzanna Sherry I think the 11th Amendment is mostly used

554
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,344
States from their own illegal act

555
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,160
I don't think that's a good thing

556
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,000
The 11th Amendment today causes all kinds of

557
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:51,072
The pain if you happen to have a run-in with

558
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:56,192
State the tribe says the lake is part of a watershed sacred to the Coeur d'Alene Indian

559
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,496
But since the Supreme Court

560
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
The state

561
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,152
Can't be sued you mean to tell me even if he's Medicaid recipients are right but neener neener neener

562
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,992
I can't sue you and hold you accountable and you're free to violate the law

563
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,832
Florida refuse to negotiate with the Seminole tribe

564
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,624
And so the Seminole tribe trade

565
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,904
Sue them in federal court

566
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,184
Springport said nope

567
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,024
I feel that the people that will hurt from

568
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,400
Smoking cigarettes should be compensated for it will be difficult

569
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,936
Because the 11th Amendment

570
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:31,008
Protect States from federal lawsuits for monetary damage

571
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,568
This is why the 11th Amendment is soaked

572
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:40,480
Let me see think like should we just get rid of the 11th Amendment like should we be going full appendectomy

573
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,760
Well

574
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
I think

575
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,344
I think that might be a pretty good metaphor

576
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
Stop it. There is a

577
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,928
Butte it's as if they're word

578
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,208
Dispute among

579
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
Doctors

580
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,560
About whether the appendix was actually a useful or

581
00:29:54,816 --> 00:30:00,960
Yes there is there absolutely is. Oh I didn't know that they've just come out with a study that says

582
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,240
Actually

583
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,520
The appendix

584
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
Might be useful

585
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:11,712
So like when there's a time of turmoil in the stomach as they caught like a diarrheal episode

586
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:15,552
What to use that on the podcast

587
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
Watch me

588
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,136
So I just want to kind of like walk

589
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,416
2 Step by Step

590
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:24,768
A diarrheal episode

591
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:31,424
Heather Smith again is one of the people who discovered this so let's say for instance you had a tourist who went to

592
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,472
Another country and got some kind of serious

593
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
Gastrointestinal

594
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,544
Issue and they had

595
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,104
Episodes of diarrhea when your body

596
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
Flushing everything out

597
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,200
The appendix actually has this kind of

598
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
What a

599
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,760
Beautiful function

600
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,832
The appendix may serve as a safe house

601
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,160
Bund of a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria

602
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,464
So maybe the appendix

603
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,512
Isn't vestigial like Darwin

604
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:01,376
The term that we use in an evolutionary biology is called an ex app

605
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
Patient

606
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,424
Though it's where

607
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,960
A structure

608
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:08,288
Serves an Adaptive function but it's not its original

609
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:14,432
Function in the same way the 11th amendments day looks very different than it did in 1790

610
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,504
That's because the Supreme Court

611
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,528
Bandit

612
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:22,368
Is that the 11th means a lot more than it says

613
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,392
It protects

614
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,672
Against

615
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,952
All kinds of suits

616
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
Of course there are exceptions

617
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:32,352
But it means a lot of times a Floridian can't sue Florida for damages

618
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,168
It also might mean you can't sue a state that's

619
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,216
Choosing to be a sanctuary for immigrants

620
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,520
Depending on who you are

621
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,800
You might need that

622
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,360
Or you might see it as a good thing

623
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
A reservoir

624
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,432
First state power

625
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:49,760
A critical piece that finishes the federalism puzzle

626
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,344
The top of the Tenth Amendment Dome the penumbra

627
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,648
Of the 11th Amendment

628
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,960
Julia Longoria with that liner notes for the 11th Amendment

629
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
