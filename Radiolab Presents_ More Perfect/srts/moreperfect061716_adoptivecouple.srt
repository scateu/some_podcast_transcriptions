Right now

7
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,024
Capacitor is working madly on a story about a Supreme Court case that will be decided any minute

8
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,560
Most important

9
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,096
Supreme Court cases this term

10
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,632
Maybe in my lifetime

11
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,960
But in the meantime I wanted to share something with you guys

12
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:20,128
As you may know that this podcast new podcast for listening to more perfect is radiolab's first ever

13
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,896
Spin-off

14
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,944
The episode for me

15
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,016
The Radiolab episode for me that inspired

16
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,416
Me to try out this whole series it actually goes back to 2012 it was our first time ever reporting about

17
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
Greencore

18
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:39,072
I asked the entire team at Radiolab to look at the docket for that year pick a case make a few calls with sword

19
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
Experiment

20
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
Twitter Tim Howard

21
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,168
Came back with the following

22
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,216
About a little girl

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
Becomes

24
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,800
The center of a very big

25
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,872
This is the story that got us hooked

26
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,152
I'm thinking about this

27
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,200
And in many ways

28
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,248
It inspired us to

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,528
Make more perfect

30
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,856
Houston so I first

31
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,440
I first heard about this story I saw it listed on the

32
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,464
Supreme Court DACA

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
Different cases

34
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,024
Is that they were going to be hearing

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
This spring

36
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,608
Well the name of the cases baby girl versus adoptive couple

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,912
Actually in strict legal parlance

38
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,960
Is called adoptive couple V baby girl

39
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
That's not a particularly catchy name

40
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:27,968
Associate professor of law at the University of South Carolina

41
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,760
Stood out to me because

42
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,600
At first that this would even be a Supreme Court case

43
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,416
It seemed more like a straightforward custody case

44
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,184
Right

45
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
But

46
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,512
When you dig in

47
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:47,168
There's a lot going on here text messages

48
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,240
And it is not straightforward

49
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,776
At all fairly not

50
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,080
So let me walk you through it the way that I learned about

51
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,640
The Story begins with a couple

52
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,688
Matt and Melanie capobianco

53
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:05,088
They are a couple who live down here in South Carolina he's a technician at Boeing she's a developmental psychology

54
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
Just nice middle-class

55
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,928
Why couple they're in their late 30s

56
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,512
You really wanted to have a kid they had gone through

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,584
Infertility problems it wasn't working out

58
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
So

59
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,912
Eventually they decide to adopt

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,472
Enter a woman named Christy Maldonado

61
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,264
She lives about a thousand miles away

62
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,848
I believe she's in Oklahoma she's in her twenties already has a couple kids

63
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
She's pregnant

64
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
And decides that she wants to give

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
The baby up for adoption

66
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
And

67
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,760
Apex the capobiancos

68
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
And

69
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
Everyone seems happier capobiancos get the baby and the name are Veronica

70
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,256
Almost that time of our family called it at

71
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,304
Boss ladies is everybody around

72
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
This is Matt and Melanie capobianco

73
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,400
But you were happy to do whatever she told you

74
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,520
Poster child for a proud father you know

75
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
It's just gone

76
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,664
That's wrong as it could have possibly gone

77
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,576
This basic layout on folded on TV news

78
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,976
Young child ripped from the arms of the only parents she's ever known and turned over to the Native Americans

79
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:21,375
Logical father she is never met a man Veronica had never even met what happens when Veronica was too

80
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:27,775
Biological dad turned up seemingly out of nowhere and according to these clips had been around for two years had abandoned

81
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,079
Child and now he's asking for custody

82
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,223
In a court is making them stand by and just let it happen

83
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,623
Well it's mainly because of this walk in child welfare at the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act

84
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
Dustin the dad

85
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:49,535
He's Cherokee you support the Cherokee Nation that makes his daughter Veronica eligible to be Cherokee

86
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:56,191
In the laws designed to keep Indian families together preference to Indian kids staying with Indian parents

87
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,007
So even though he actually sign papers

88
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,031
Green to the adoption

89
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,079
He was able to invoke this lot

90
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,871
And get custody of Veronica

91
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,919
Side is Cassidy way

92
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
Ben

93
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
Uses cherry kienast

94
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
Reverse

95
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,855
The rights he signed away to hang on is all going to make sense

96
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391
Okay but you text Elliott

97
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
Yeah

98
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,743
New Year's Eve 2011

99
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
With cameras rolling

100
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,327
Dustin Brown drives his pickup truck

101
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
Charleston

102
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:31,263
Matt and Melanie capobianco flush to two-year-old Veronica could possibly be the last time

103
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:37,663
Hyundai hold their baby as her mom and dad and that evening Veronica is transferred to Dustin

104
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,063
And she like we had enough time for her to be Not Afraid when she

105
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,535
Assassin gets into the truck

106
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,607
Holding his two-year-old daughter for the first time

107
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
The reporter asks him

108
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,679
Do you think this is in her best interest

109
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
And this is all you hear from

110
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,823
I think so we need to give her a call

111
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,127
Have you ever seen the child support

112
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,711
They declined any further comment on camera

113
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,015
He gets into the truck with Veronica

114
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,063
And they drive away

115
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
Back to Oklahoma

116
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:22,463
Can I do can I ask you what was it when was the last time that you spoke with Veronica

117
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
The day after

118
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
The day after

119
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
Yeah

120
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
Spoke to her for about two men

121
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
Totally love Darren

122
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
I love you Mommy and I love

123
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Love you Daddy

124
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
Just few minutes

125
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
Able

126
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
InTouch

127
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
And that was 16 months

128
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,791
How long was Veronica with him again before this have

129
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
About two years

130
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,351
Oh man that's

131
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
It's hard

132
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,703
And you know when I first heard about this case

133
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,263
That's basically the

134
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,591
The only way I thought of it you know it's just

135
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,639
That's a crazy Injustice

136
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
That's basically all I

137
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,711
Saw

138
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,015
And for someone with no background in this

139
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,319
Then you see a case like the baby Veronica case

140
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,903
Where's this coming from how can this possibly be okay

141
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:29,279
Does Marshalls drug again in her article for slate kind of caught me off guard because the title was

142
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,327
Doing what's best for the tribe

143
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,911
2 year old Veronica was ripped from the only home she's ever known

144
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,471
The court made the right decision

145
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
Yeah

146
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,335
So I called up Tasker like what do you mean by that

147
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,895
But I think important to realize is that

148
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
The problems

149
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
But

150
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,319
Equi was intended to address didn't stop happening

151
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:58,719
Long ago and in this is where the story

152
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Turn into the

153
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:05,375
Biggest rabbit hole I've ever falling and didn't tell you

154
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,191
The only way you can begin to wrap your mind around

155
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,263
What's right and what's wrong in this story is

156
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,311
Go back to the six

157
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,407
How you doing how are you

158
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,431
Turkish

159
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,039
Lawyer who lives in Long Island now which is where I visited him

160
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,111
But in 1967 the fall of 67

161
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,183
I was on the staff of the association on American Indian Affairs

162
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,255
Sort of a legal advocacy group for American Indians

163
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,815
Any traveled all over working with different tribes

164
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
And

165
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
One day

166
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,679
Where he gets a phone call from this guy Lewis good house

167
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:44,799
The tribal chair the Devil's Lake Sioux Tribe in North Dakota and a guy says

168
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,823
I really need your help

169
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,127
He said there's a child

170
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
Devil's Lake kid one of ours

171
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:56,319
It was just abruptly taken away by social workers the Benson County North Dakota Social Services age

172
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
Agency came in

173
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
And they took

174
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
Little Ivan Brown

175
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,439
Away from

176
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,999
His a grandmother he was sick

177
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,583
Order stated reason for taking driving away

178
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,399
Neglect because what because grandma wasn't

179
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:17,055
Wasn't around no actually bird says that the social workers were looking for that classic nuclear family allowed

180
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
Magical mother

181
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,127
Biological father children

182
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:24,223
So when they saw him with an older relative but no Mom or Dad they thought

183
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,319
And they took him away the tribal council was

184
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Really

185
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Upset by

186
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,183
They wanted to

187
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
Fight a battle

188
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:40,607
Took the case but in court in that case by the way this is Alex Forney she got Ivan back

189
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
After

190
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
Somewhat protracted battle

191
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
But

192
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,751
He began to wonder how widespread is this

193
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,359
2.67 to the end of 68 into 69

194
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
The tribe after tribe

195
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
Doing interview

196
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,455
And he says that everywhere he went

197
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
He would hear these stories

198
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,039
I remember it vividly

199
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
This is Deb Wells

200
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,135
She's a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe

201
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:07,999
When she was 10 years old A car pulled into her driveway

202
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
Social workers

203
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
And I got out of car

204
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,631
I told my brothers and sisters I said go high

205
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
And

206
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:19,007
They had to drag this out from underneath the bed got around and got in the house

207
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,567
Then I caucus to Scottsbluff

208
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,871
And Patricia foster home

209
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,407
It looks horrible

210
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
This was

211
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,199
Just part of

212
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,527
Every native families history

213
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,087
She grew up on the Pine Ridge reservation in South

214
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,671
Dakota I remember when I was young we go to one of the Border towns

215
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
And my grandma

216
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Would say

217
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,255
Stay in the car

218
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
Lock yourself in

219
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,863
Don't get out of the car I'm going into the Trading Post

220
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
Cuz they're going to steal you

221
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
Really yeah

222
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,727
What we found

223
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:56,127
Is that not every reservation

224
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,175
Photos of Standing Rock reservation

225
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,223
You couldn't not find the family

226
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,039
That didn't know of a child in placement

227
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
Social Services

228
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,671
And told my

229
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,767
Mother and dad that they were taking a bridge for physical check-up

230
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,559
And Alice pack

231
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,143
Michael says that his dad spent the next

232
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
30 years looking for

233
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,263
People that he was interviewing

234
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,847
What reason did the social workers give you for taking the child

235
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,895
An answer that he got ran the gamut

236
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
Conditions of poverty

237
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
Alcohol

238
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,271
Overcrowding maybe they don't have adequate

239
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:40,671
Ventilation in the house no indoor plumbing but in most cases he says the reasons would have stood up in court

240
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,975
They would put papers in front of them and they would sign

241
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
It was signing some families

242
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,607
If they could they tried to fight it but they usually couldn't afford to

243
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,911
Book the tribal people of poor

244
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,471
So we began to do with

245
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
Statistical collection

246
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Of data

247
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,543
State-by-state

248
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,103
Asking how many Indian kids are in foster care

249
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,919
Respite care adoptive placement and institutional place

250
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:05,759
Juvenile facilities money arrived at the end of that analysis

251
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:10,367
Is a pretty shocking number

252
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,415
About one-third

253
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:16,767
Of Indian children wear in out-of-home placements in non-indian setting

254
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
1/3

255
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,143
25 to 35% of Indian children Nationwide

256
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
Where in out-of-home placement

257
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:28,543
That's a real number that is a real number that's the number you see sighted again and again

258
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,847
Nobody connected the dots

259
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,639
Everybody thought

260
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
That it was their own

261
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
Personal

262
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Tragedy

263
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
Nobody realized

264
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,087
That this was a pattern and a

265
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,647
That was decimating these cry

266
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,719
How would this happen on this scale

267
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,815
I mean like with the supposition a bunch of social workers making the same decision in the

268
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
Dependently

269
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
Where is Italy

270
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,423
Policy well at this is basically the social workers

271
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,983
Very much acting in the spirit of the day

272
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,311
Because you have to keep in mind that in the fifties and sixties

273
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,663
You have all these government policies that are put in place

274
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
Who's

275
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,479
Entire purpose is basically two

276
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,527
Tried it once and for all solve this

277
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,831
Indian problem that's going on and on

278
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:18,207
You got this guy 1953 is a senator from Utah starts basically trying to terminate the tribe

279
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,255
You mean like take away their sovereignty

280
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,351
Yeah he goes tribe to tribe trying to convince them or force them

281
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,911
Tell them they have no there's no way out of it

282
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
He argues

283
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:33,567
That this will be best for all of them

284
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
To integrate them

285
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,407
Yeah the whole

286
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,735
They will melt into the wider culture that's what we'll save them

287
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
Part of this was

288
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,831
Part of the social workers that were working that.

289
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,623
They were working under the auspice

290
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,159
Pictures of a thing called the Indian adoption

291
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
Which

292
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
Was very much about

293
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,999
That ideas

294
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,559
You take these kids from their poor condition

295
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,607
And you connect them directly

296
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
Two white families that are looking

297
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
How to adopt

298
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,983
So far this is definitely top down very much

299
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
In any case

300
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,103
The end result of this is that a third of these kids are being taken away

301
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:11,199
There were literally communities where there were no children

302
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
That's Terry cross

303
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,831
He's executive director of the national Indian Child Welfare Association

304
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,623
In Minnesota there were community

305
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
It's where there were no children

306
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
In flask

307
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,231
There were communities where there were no children

308
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
I mean what is

309
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
What is a culture except

310
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,095
Healthy ideas and

311
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
Traditions that you pass on to your kids

312
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,471
That's Marsha's ugh again if you are hemorrhaging your children

313
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
Then you're going to disappear

314
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,055
So what would you do

315
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,639
Well it's to mass of a problem if you trying to fight

316
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,735
All these removals of kids on a case-by-case basis fugetaboutit

317
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:50,367
A national laws needed so Bert spent years Walking The Halls of Congress literally

318
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,023
Endless lobbying Congressional hearings until finally

319
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:01,375
So it does a lot but basically when it comes to adoptions

320
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
They will have placement preferen

321
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,215
So the first preference would be

322
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,239
With the immediate

323
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,287
So you removed from Mom your

324
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
Place with Dad

325
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,151
Maybe with Grandmother they say no second preference would be

326
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
Someone else in the tribe

327
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,455
+ 1/3

328
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,247
Is any other American Indian

329
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,831
Any other and then after that

330
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,879
Other than the child could be placed with

331
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Another family

332
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
Well so if you're white

333
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
And you're trying to adopt Indian

334
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,559
Yeah yeah a lot of rope

335
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Yes

336
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
But

337
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
By and large

338
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
Most of us think that echoes

339
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
Probably

340
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
The

341
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
Best Federal Indian law ever

342
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,847
Did the most to

343
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
Help Indian tribes

344
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
Respect tribal sovereignty

345
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
And really fulfill the United

346
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
This is trust relationship

347
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
With America

348
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,367
But now because of this case

349
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:00,511
That law may be in jeopardy

350
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,679
Will continue in a moment

351
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,943
Tom Chatham Rod this is more perfect run the middle of a story that was

352
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
Our first attempt at

353
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,015
Supreme Court Reporting

354
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
And

355
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
Reporter Tim Howard

356
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:31,999
So in April I went to this conference in Tulsa

357
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,047
Big room there are 700 people there

358
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:40,191
Muslim work in child welfare organizations in Indian communities around the country

359
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:44,287
There was some traditional Cherokee drumming their films Workshop

360
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:50,175
All anybody could talk about but this case there is no issue

361
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,479
How the baby Veronica case may

362
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:58,879
Fact the Indian child welfare act so please please do keep

363
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,695
Baby Veronica and her family in your prayers

364
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,767
Everybody was on it really worried

365
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:10,143
In this situation this is Terry cross again he's one of the organizers and

366
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
He told me that

367
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
Look

368
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
The capobiancos

369
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,495
I feel for them

370
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,335
But in what world is it okay for one family

371
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:24,991
Who feels they were damaged by a law to put thousands of other children at Jeopardy

372
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:30,367
For their own hurt I can't imagine a world where that's okay

373
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,695
Well I mean it's hard

374
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
For us to say that because

375
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,791
You know that's not what motivated us

376
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,583
Our daughters what's motivating us

377
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,143
Well how we feel we just feel that in

378
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,935
And this case is it was a

379
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,519
Beautiful law that was put into place to prevent the breakup of families

380
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
Indian families

381
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
I just think it wasn't

382
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,943
Really supposed to be applied to situation like ours

383
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,015
They say but we get it there's a huge

384
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,295
Storical wrong here

385
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,343
What does that have to do with us

386
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,415
Reminds me of arguments it happened over affirmative action

387
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,975
Ridley definitely but hear the details are

388
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,279
Are are so different you know they say

389
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,071
This is a law that was

390
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:15,679
Created to protect Indian families right

391
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,263
You got a white couple and then you got it Dad was out of the picture so

392
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,871
You're not actually protecting Indian family you are forcibly creating a new one

393
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:29,759
Absolutely I mean the process you're breaking up a loving home and I don't think that was the Ben 10 of the law ever

394
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,319
I asked my personal opinion is that

395
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,903
Aqua has outlived its usefulness

396
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
What causes more problems then

397
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
That's awesome

398
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
This is Mark Fiddler

399
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:46,143
I want to see Chinese for Matt and Melanie capobianco he also happens to be Native American himself

400
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:52,543
Enrolled member of the turtle Mountain band of Chippewa Indians that's a reservation up in North Dakota right on the boardwalk

401
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:59,711
And I was right kind of fell off foot into culture so to speak I go back to the Rasmus summer and Mark actually used to argue the other

402
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
Other side

403
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,015
The most important thing was to

404
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,807
Keep Indian families together

405
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
Annette Indian kids score place

406
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
And on Indian homes

407
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,439
Experience emotional

408
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
Psychological harm by

409
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
Being raised outside of the culture

410
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,815
But then I got a case in

411
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,095
Bus 94

412
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,375
Which gave him pause

413
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
Boy

414
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,703
That's a good word

415
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:27,871
With a K sandwiches Young American Indian girl at Sierra wanted to be adopted by this white couple

416
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
And Mark

417
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,711
Opposed it in my heart of hearts I knew it was

418
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
Probably

419
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,295
Not the right thing for the child

420
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,831
He won the case

421
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,623
She was removed from the couple's home

422
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,975
Sierra would tell you herself she had the

423
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,767
She had a pretty rough life

424
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,375
She bounced in and out of more than 20 foster homes

425
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,167
Runaway many many times

426
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,471
And got into serious trouble with the law

427
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
It always nag me

428
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
Mark says even though the tribes

429
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
Suffered

430
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,127
That doesn't change the fact that if you

431
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,919
Take a kid out of a loving home

432
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
You're going to cause her real

433
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
Harm

434
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,015
And he says that's why he took

435
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,575
Because the capobiancos know they are

436
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,903
Among the most loving people I know

437
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,231
He said they did everything you could ask her just amazing people

438
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,303
Emmett the birth mother Christine Maldonado when she was pregnant

439
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,839
They got to know her she

440
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,631
Tell the connection to them

441
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,959
That's Lori Miguel's she's represented Christy since last year

442
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,287
And they were also willing to have an open adoption

443
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,103
Yeah we still have a relationship with Kris TV

444
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,687
We love her to death and Crissy give birth to Veronica they were there

445
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,479
With her in the delivery room

446
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,551
The day she was born a cut the cord

447
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
Matt

448
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,599
Capobianco cut the

449
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,695
Umbilical cord so that's such a degree of intimacy that I

450
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:49,023
I know I mean having given birth twice myself

451
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,607
Did anyone other than my husband would be

452
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
In the rooms

453
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,959
It's kind of scary but that it gives you some idea of how she felt about the

454
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
Capobianco

455
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,055
Now as for Dustin Brown Veronica's biological dad

456
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,127
A couple months before she was born Christy the birth mom

457
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,943
Send him a text message asking him

458
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,991
Pay child support or

459
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,527
He wants to waive his rights

460
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
And he replied

461
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,831
I waive my right

462
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,855
Rather than pay

463
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,647
A dime in child support

464
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,232
Well there's a contrast

465
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:23,584
So the beginning it sounds like he did not want to be a dad a few months later

466
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
Key

467
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,472
Things to make it even more official by signing a form agreeing to the adopt

468
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,544
And then he changes his mind yeah you know

469
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,360
Obviously I was wondering what was he thinking

470
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,712
Cuz you can't avoid the fact that how you feel about this guy

471
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:45,088
Is going to influence how you feel about this law and so I was trying to get in touch with him I was

472
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:51,232
Pestering his lawyers will he do an interview this one on for weeks and and they were basically like

473
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,280
He doesn't want to do interviews

474
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
He doesn't want to talk

475
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,632
Yeah yeah he said he didn't get him

476
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,104
Shortly before we're going to wrap this story

477
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,664
I got an email saying come to Oklahoma

478
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,832
He lives in this one story house on this tree line block

479
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,136
In a small town north of Tulsa

480
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:23,488
Hey how's it going

481
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,560
What it look like is it a very

482
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
Normal looking guy

483
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,888
A little bit of an army haircut

484
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
He had a stash

485
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
That night when you got Veronica

486
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:36,032
But he's clean-shaven now smile

487
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:40,896
So anyway we go inside and the first thing he tells me

488
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,200
Is that Veronica's not there

489
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,528
She was out with his wife Robin

490
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
Because I with my wife

491
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,344
Turns out he's remarried

492
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,744
In any case testis alright we sat down at the kitchen table and started talking

493
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Something tell me like where we are

494
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,632
Dustin Brown for Nowata Oklahoma this is my house

495
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,960
I'm part of the wolf Clan

496
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,752
Oakland is 107 Cherokee

00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,568
Wiki Clans and my name Dustin

498
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
Meads

499
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
Brave Warrior

500
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
And I

501
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Turkey

502
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,968
Next you know join the Army up and

503
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,504
Dover Dirac I'm like wow

504
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,296
I'm here for the Cherokees

505
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,344
I'm brave Warrior outing

506
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
Desert

507
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,208
He's been registered member since he was a little kid

508
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:30,304
His parents were members and their parents and he said he's proud to be Cherokee

509
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,584
Basically because it means that

510
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,632
He's from where he lives

511
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,656
What's the big deal to me

512
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
So anyway we

513
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:41,312
Sorry talking about the case and it gets complicated there's a lot of detail not going to go into all of it

514
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:46,432
Basically he and Christy Maldonado the birth mom we've known each other since we were 16

515
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,224
We've dated off and on

516
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,088
2008 he joins the Army basic training he lives on a base it's far as away

517
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,904
Panda Christmas time that year

518
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,440
He basically says

519
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,720
Let's Get Serious

520
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,048
Got down on one knee and proposed to her said hey

521
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,584
I want to bring into my life

522
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,144
She said okay that's just great

523
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
And

524
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,192
Almost a month later

525
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,776
She send me a message saying that she was pregnant and

526
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
I was excited

527
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,336
I mean

528
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,384
I have children with her was

529
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,944
Was one of the things I wanted at that time

530
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,528
Told her I can move you and your kids up to the base

531
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,832
Housing was going to be free on base

532
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,136
There was schools for her kids she could

533
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,440
Get a job right there on base you know

534
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,512
Everything was taken care of me and everything was going great now

535
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
And then

536
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,840
Pretty quickly the whole thing just sour

537
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:40,448
It's impossible to know exactly what happened but Christie says that Dustin

538
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,984
Just simply didn't offer any

539
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
Support

540
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,032
He says that he

541
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,080
Did Harry tried to at least

542
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,408
But shortly after she got pregnant she basically just shut them out

543
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,944
Stop taking his calls

544
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,344
I didn't get no phone calls no text message nothing from Riley blue and on the cycle what's going on he says that he tried to get in touch with

545
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,136
Trying to call her

546
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,416
Still no answer

547
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:06,048
A couple times that I've went back to the bars and went to her house though there's 4 hours from the base

548
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,840
Knocked on her door I can hear

549
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,888
You know voices in the house

550
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,728
I sound like her and the kids they wouldn't answer the door for me

551
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,520
Then one day he says

552
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,544
She sent me a

553
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,824
Message saying

554
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,616
I don't want to be with you no more

555
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,920
+ 3 weeks after that she's like

556
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,224
I want you to sign your rights over

557
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
His parental rights

558
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
Would you sign your rights over

559
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,160
You guys are texting this we talkin

560
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,720
Show the whole time we're text messaging this

561
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,792
Because she wouldn't talk to me what did you think it meant

562
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,072
To me I just

563
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,632
Does she wanted me to sign my rights over to her

564
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,400
And I'm like

565
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,704
This summer I really don't want to do

566
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
He says

567
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,520
She kept texting him that question

568
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,080
And looming in his mind was

569
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:53,408
The fact that he just learned so we're going to be going to Iraq to

570
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:58,272
The radar Mission so he starts to wonder what's the right thing to do here

571
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,856
There was one of chances I was going to come back I want to make the right choice and

572
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
But the mother

573
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,416
BSO parent he says

574
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:09,280
That he's holding out hope that if he does make it back will get back together and she'll just change your mind

575
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,864
Finally told her I was like alright I'm signing rights over

576
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,400
Months go by

577
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:19,008
Christy has a baby peace as he doesn't know exactly when because they weren't speaking

578
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,568
But then six days before

579
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,616
I had to go to the port of Iraq

580
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,920
I get a phone call from

581
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,992
Some guy in Washington County the process server

582
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,016
Said hey

583
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,064
We need you to sign some papers so you sign your

584
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,648
Restaurants over by directed him to an office right near the base

585
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,672
Went there

586
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,744
Sign the paper and what did you think that man

587
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,792
The whole time I thought I was just

588
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,120
You know the paperwork for me sign customized to her

589
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
But

590
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,192
When I got done sign the guy said

591
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:51,264
You just sign your rights away instead of the biological mother

592
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,080
There's been up for adoption and she's been living in South Carolina

593
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
4 months

594
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:03,040
Dustin says this is the first moment that he realized what was actually happening

595
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,088
That the baby was up for adoption

596
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,184
And he says that he had no idea he had just legally can send it to it

597
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,232
I should have had a lawyer there with me

598
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:17,888
At that point I might grab the paper and the guy looked at me and said if you going to rip that up he said

599
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,216
It's not good to do that

600
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,800
That he could be arrested and also what do I got to do

601
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:29,152
He said you get a lawyer which he immediately did

602
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:33,760
That's why the courts have ruled in his favor because they say that from that moment

603
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:38,112
He's clearly demonstrated that he wants to be her dad I mean I never

604
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,392
Never once

605
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:43,488
They don't want to give up on my daughter never once that I want to give her up

606
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,792
I mean everybody says that I gave her up

607
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,328
Never wanted to

608
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
Mark and Lori say that

609
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,168
If this were any other guy

610
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:55,520
Any other man of any other race whose story would be over right about it

611
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,800
It's too late

612
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,616
He wouldn't have any rights at all under every State's laws

613
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,688
Too late under the Federal Constitution too late

614
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
He rejected

615
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,272
That opportunity to become a father

616
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,320
He has one thing in his favor

617
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
Teslore

618
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
He happens to be Cherokee

619
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,976
And because of that fact not only can distort of man

620
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,328
But he gets an automatic transfer of custody to him

621
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:22,912
Mark and Lori see that as basically the worst kind of preferential

622
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,728
Treatment and that is unbelievable

623
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,848
This is John John Nichols this is Shannon Shannon Jen's Dustin's lawyers

624
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:34,176
And John says okay there's preferential treatment

625
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:40,832
But think about why all the protections of iqua are there he's Roblox what they are for a reason we went over this earlier but

626
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,648
You know basically people are being manipulated out of their kids

627
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:50,304
Emoji might like to think that that's ancient history now fast forward to 2010

628
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
The same thing is happening in this

629
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,144
We have a registered member

630
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,424
Of the Cherokee Nation

631
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,728
We have his child

632
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,544
Being given up for adoption without his knowledge

633
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,336
And without his consent

634
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,152
And they kept this adoption from him for months

635
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,688
And then spring it on him six

636
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,992
Days before he leaves the country

637
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:15,392
It looks to us like it was engineered to make sure he got served but not enough time to where he could put

638
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:18,464
Put up a fight I believe it was absolutely intentional

639
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,744
Enchanted suggest

640
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,560
That they knew about Equity new would apply

641
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,840
And they were trying to sidestep

642
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:30,240
Are so many errors

643
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:33,056
There's one important form where Shannon says

644
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,104
That they went out of their way

645
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:40,480
To make it look like Veronica is not Native American

646
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
That's just dumb

647
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:47,136
It's a Preposterous argument another for Mark and Lori say the reason that nobody puts Cherokee

648
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,184
And big bright flaming letters

649
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
Simple

650
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,512
Chrissy herself is predominantly Hispanic

651
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,816
Dustin is predominantly

652
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,888
Caucasian and is approximately 2% Cherokee

653
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
What

654
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,216
Did you say 2%

655
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:05,056
Yai Veronica herself a b a little bit over one person

656
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,640
Wait this whole thing is happening because he's only 2%

657
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,432
Well you look at changes things come out

658
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,224
Well yeah but you have to keep in mind that

659
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,248
Cherokee Nation

660
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:17,856
Doesn't care about the percentage of Cherokee in your blood that's not how they determine their members

661
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,160
Being a member of the Cherokee Nation

662
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,000
Is like being a member of the United States you are a

663
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,536
Citizen of the nation

664
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
You know if

665
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,096
If your parents are US citizen

666
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:33,216
You're automatically a citizen Assistant Attorney General for Cherokee Nation

667
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:37,824
If your parents are Cherokee citizen you're automatically a citizen but you can automatically apply

668
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,128
So it's based on Direct lineage

669
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,408
But still

670
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,992
You're right because this is the argument that is most troubling

671
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:45,760
To the tribe

672
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,856
Both Chrissi Nimmo and marshes ugh told me that

673
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,136
If the Supreme Court

674
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
Ends up deciding

675
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:58,816
Equi is unconstitutional because it really is race-based unconstitutional cuz it's race-based preference

676
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:02,400
It calls into question every single federal Indian law

677
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,704
There goes Indian law

678
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,544
This is a case that they could use to do that

679
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,944
If iqua falls because it's unconstitutional

680
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,736
You could have a crazy domino effect

681
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,272
Every single

682
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,296
Federal Indian law

683
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,576
Is premise

684
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,344
On

685
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,648
Giving some sort of special treatment Indian

686
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:30,048
What would that mean concretely if

687
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:36,448
Indian Longwood to go away it means that their policing the court system education anything to do as a

688
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,264
The Sovereign Nation all of that just evaporates

689
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,872
A tribe would just become another group of people

690
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
On

691
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
Summerland

692
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,992
That said

693
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
This is not

694
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,064
The likely outcome

695
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,112
No

696
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:58,976
The Supreme Court will probably rule as narrowly as they possibly can

697
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,024
And as far as the tribes are concerned

698
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,120
They can do a lot of damage to the law without calling it unconstitutional

699
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,168
You know they could allow for

700
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:07,936
This

701
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,240
Certain kind of exception to iqua

702
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:14,336
Which would make it a lot easier for people like the capobianco is to adopt

703
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,872
So they can roll any number of

704
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
Yeah

705
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,176
And the thing is that

706
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,456
It's all

707
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,736
Strangely connected

708
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
To this

709
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,320
I figured maybe three year old girl

710
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,624
No signs of this I'm thinking I'm just going to

711
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
Suncoast

712
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,208
So when when she finally showed up

713
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,512
Halfway through my interview with Dustin

714
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
Hello

715
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
Hi

716
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,376
It was kind of surreal

717
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:40,704
Date my daughter Veronica though Daddy

718
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,752
Hey Veronica on Tim

719
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,360
She's got dark curly hair she's a ball of energy

720
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,688
This definitely bullheaded

721
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,504
Within a minute

722
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,784
She's giving me a tour of

723
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,088
Every single object in her room

724
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:57,856
And this

725
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,160
I mean everything

726
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,184
Gummy bear

727
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
Army bear

728
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,256
Marijuana daddy dog tags on it

729
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,328
She was a very very proud

730
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,608
Cool host

731
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,216
Few minutes later if she wanted to show me her

732
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:18,336
I don't think I've seen geese in a long time

733
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,200
Desert desert real

734
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:29,600
Yeah she feed them out of her hand

735
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,536
Liberty

736
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:43,936
Thomas the Train so

737
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,520
Happened to her but if the Supreme Court said

738
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,592
Dustin Brown shouldn't have qualified

739
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,616
As father

740
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,968
What they do is they would send it back down to a South Carolina

741
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,552
And then they would have this new best interest evaluation

742
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,880
Basically like what's the best thing for her at this point

743
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,928
She's been with him now for

744
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,208
About a year-and-a-half

745
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,744
Cancel that actually

746
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,048
Might really change the calculation

747
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,120
10 mm

748
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:15,936
Honestly

749
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
Hanging out with

750
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,520
Her and Dustin

751
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,800
In the backyard

752
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,872
Is really easy to forget

753
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:27,200
All these people whose lives are just

754
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,784
Completely Tangled Up In This scene

755
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,928
Christy Maldonado the birth mom

756
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:43,328
She intended to give Veronica life has been going on for

757
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:51,008
We've kind of been in a holding pattern for like well forever is waiting and waiting waiting

758
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:56,896
Of course that the hundreds of tribes are just worried about their own kids

759
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,064
Pretty cool are you a good swimmer

760
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,464
Bad summer

761
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,864
Summer you not cutest member

762
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:23,264
Anima vestra marry you just Miller

763
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,080
Yeah

764
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:34,016
So the Supreme Court came to a decision on this ruling about a month after we first air this podcast

765
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,040
And hit here

766
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:35,808
What they say

767
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,624
Okay so the Supreme Court ruled

768
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,904
Five four

769
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,464
In favor of the adoptive couple

770
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,256
Which is to say against the birth

771
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,792
To Dustin Brown the dab

772
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,096
It was like a 60-page

773
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,888
Ruling and

774
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
Not being

775
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,984
Totally confident with all the ramifications were

776
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,800
I just made some calls

777
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,128
Hi how are you

778
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,152
I'm doing great how are

779
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,200
For example I Skype

780
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,480
With Marcia Zug

781
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,528
Who you remember from the pieces

782
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,856
She's a law professor at the University of South Carolina

783
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,416
Can you walk me through what this opinion means

784
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,488
Well in terms of

785
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,768
Veronica's placement

786
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,072
How to come out the other way

787
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,680
Then it would be over she would stay with Dustin Brown her biological father

788
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
End of story

789
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,240
What we have now

790
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,288
Is the court of holding

791
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,824
The termination of his parental rights

792
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:36,224
So basically the Supreme Court ruled that Dustin Brown shouldn't have been allowed to invoke the Indian Child Welfare Act

793
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,320
Because he didn't have what's called continuing custody of Veronica

794
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,856
Continuing custody

795
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:48,256
Right there argue that this other about preventing the breakup of Indian families and there was no Indian fam

796
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,840
Only here because they didn't live together dad and a daughter to write

797
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,168
So they don't scrap the Indian Child Welfare Act

798
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,728
They just say that it shouldn't applied in case like this

799
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,544
So basically according to Tim it was

800
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,824
Is pretty narrow ruling

801
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,104
What then

802
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,688
Is it the Supreme Court kick the case down to a lower court

803
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:09,504
South Carolina and that lower court ultimately

804
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,832
Awarded custody of Veronica to the Kappa Beyond

805
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,136
Dustin Brown try to fight it

806
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,416
There are lots of lawsuits

807
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:18,464
It's flying back and forth in both directions

808
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,744
But in the end

809
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
Veronica

810
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,792
Did end up

811
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
Going to the

812
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,424
Send two and a half weeks since our daughter Veronica

813
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,472
Peppermint Malachi Bianca

814
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,800
And on October 10th 2013 Dustin Brown called The Press

815
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,872
It was a love for my daughter that kept

816
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,408
Me going all this time

817
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,968
That is it was also

818
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,272
The love for my daughter

819
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,088
Dude that finally gave me the strength

820
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,440
Things that are Beyond My Control

821
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,768
The time has come

822
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,096
For me to let Veronica live a normal childhood

823
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,400
Never so desperately needed

824
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,168
And deserve

825
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,496
Dustin Brown then announced that he would be stopping his

826
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
Forget

827
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,824
Santa Veronica

828
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,616
One day you will read

829
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,640
About this

830
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,920
Xiamen airlines

831
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,480
Never ever

832
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,504
For one second

833
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:19,904
Never ever for one second

834
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,184
How much

835
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,952
I love you

836
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,328
I thought for you

837
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,112
My home will always be your home

838
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,904
Always welcome

839
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:05,728
I miss you more than

840
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,360
My little girl

841
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,384
My princess

842
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:16,992
I will always love you until the day I die

843
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,672
One more thing

844
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,232
In our story we talked

845
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,512
A lot about

846
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,072
The possibilities are the larger possibility

847
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,376
Effective this case could be

848
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,144
Used as a

849
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,680
First step

850
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,496
To basically declare

851
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
Indian Liza

852
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,568
The race-based situation

853
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,104
Could then be negated

854
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,664
That didn't happen it is

855
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:46,944
But

856
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,248
There is a sense that they they kind of

857
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,784
Planted a seed

858
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,808
For example

859
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,112
Justice Alito who wrote the ruling

860
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:58,208
He started off with mention of Veronica being

861
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,744
1.2

862
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:00,768
Cherokee

863
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
Which

864
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:08,960
Is interesting cuz it sounds like he's about to make an argument for why this is a race-based preference and whites of

865
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,752
Violation of equal protection

866
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,288
But then he doesn't make that are gay

867
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,312
He pulls back

868
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,848
So the question is

869
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,408
Why did he start the ruling that way

870
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,712
She trying to send a message of some kind

871
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,480
I asked

872
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,504
Marsha

873
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
What you thought about

874
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,832
Why you think they started it off that way

875
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,880
I've been thinking about

876
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,768
It clearly

877
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,424
Sat wrong with at least some members of the court I mean when listening to the oral arguments you could tell that

878
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,728
And Robert's parked on it as well

879
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,032
I think it's an indication that at least some members

880
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:44,800
Court

881
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,592
Have serious

882
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,896
Reservations about Indian law

883
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,736
Because they just don't see Veronica is an Indian Child

884
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,272
To them

885
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,808
Indian is a race

886
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,904
She doesn't have enough blood to be of that race

887
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,952
Hey there's a possible

888
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,744
Indication of

889
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,584
Where future Indian law cases are going to go

890
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:23,456
Since then the Supreme Court has seen a handful of Indian law cases in the biggest development so far

891
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:27,040
Is it the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the federal government

892
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,832
Change

893
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:35,232
The rules surrounding the Indian Child Welfare act were there about you the new rule changes are going to go into effect December twenty

894
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:39,328
What you mean is that when a child like Veronica is put up for adoption

895
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:45,216
The state would have to ask whether or not she was an Indian Child the father would have to have been asked whether or not

896
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:48,032
She's an Indian Child in the state would not be able to consider

897
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:52,128
What percentage Indian blood she has in determining if she is an Indian

898
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,431
How to say the hope is that

899
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:57,247
Future veronika's will not have to go through

900
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,783
What does fraud
