Leadership support for more perfect is provided by the Joyce Foundation

00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:24,832
True symbol of the United States is not the bald eagle

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,880
It is the pendulum

6
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,928
And when the pendulum

7
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,744
Swings too far in One Direction

8
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,536
It will go bad

A series about

13
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:52,224
The cases that land in front of the Supreme Court and in this episode

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,528
Which we might as well call pendulum part 2

15
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:57,856
Take a deep dive into what might be V

16
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,928
Most horrible Supreme Court decision ever

17
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,720
In an attempt

18
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,816
160 years after the fact in a Hilton hotel Ballroom

19
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,376
To finally say it right

20
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:20,384
Can you tell me about the Constitution

21
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:26,272
This is a case that split the United States into

22
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:31,136
Civil case in question is the Dred Scott case

23
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:38,560
Which if you ask people I was wondering if you've ever heard of the Dred Scott court case

24
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:44,960
Scott sounds familiar doesn't go well

25
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,360
Teacher would be really mad at me right now

26
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,200
Civil rights thing

27
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
Earworm I'm more like the name has some familiarity yes yes

28
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536
What is that mean

29
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:22,336
So what happens a lot of times that people don't actually understand why they're free so Dred Scott

30
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:28,736
That is one of those fundamental decisions that is that lays the groundwork for the reasons why

31
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,552
We can live in a Multicultural Society

32
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,344
This is Elie mystal

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,416
More perfect legal editor really understand the case

34
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,976
You've got to go to a place called Fort Snelling

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
It's a small army base about 15 minutes north of the Minneapolis Airport

36
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,824
Go freshly laid on the ground and our producer Julie Longoria took over here

37
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,224
Number to Josie manager program here at the Minnesota Historical Society gave her tour

38
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,624
DC right now is the space that we think you know it's probably weird

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,696
Dred and Harriet Scott you know where they live

40
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:15,328
Before we go into distress set up when in time are we what's happening the 1830s worth

41
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:20,960
30 years out from the Civil War about half the states in the union have slavery about half dome

42
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,360
So it's this question that's kind of still unanswered like should we be a free Nation or should we be a slave Nation

43
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:33,248
Real tension here and there is a real understanding here that

44
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:39,648
This might not work and just as we're about to reach this Breaking Point Army doctor named John

45
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,232
John Emerson slave owner

46
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,768
Steps into free territory

47
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,584
And arrived here

48
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400
Do this

49
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
Army base

50
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,728
On a hill

51
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,544
And he brings with him his one slave

52
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,944
Dred Scott and now we're actually inside the Fortress if you will and

53
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,576
You know all of the stone all the weld windows

54
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
It's

55
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
I don't like

56
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,440
Whenever I come here I have this kind of cold feeling

57
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,488
Even if it's hot outside

58
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,655
He walks up to the back of this one squat building on the far end of the base

59
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:35,711
Can you describe the through I think we're probably looking at a

60
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
Epsom and 1/2 foot ceiling

61
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,623
Wood grain floor wood clapboard floor

62
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,415
Stone walls

63
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,231
The tiny room little bigger than a king bed

64
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,071
Is a fireplace little tables and Redwood cabinets

65
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:55,423
Is the home kitchen is a laundry places

66
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,215
You know you're One Stop Shop

67
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:05,151
And the reason this room is so important is because Dred Scott

68
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
Living in this room

69
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,783
For the first time in his life he got a taste

70
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,599
At what it might be like

71
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:18,463
To be free I mean obviously he was still a slave but

72
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:23,839
Dr. Emerson would leave the fort for months at a time and have him work for other people

73
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,959
Autonomy and Harriet and red met here

74
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:35,615
When he was here he met a girl 36-7 they met here he likes to stay

75
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:39,967
Stand here and imagine just how that money went down I can imagine

76
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,271
You know Harriet you know haven't been here

77
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,831
And and red being over by the store

78
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,927
And I'm having a conversation with someone of the other black guy that was here

79
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,511
And I imagine him saying

80
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,559
Here she comes walking by

81
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,607
Jim who is that

82
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
I'm going to make her mine

83
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
I can imagine

84
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
Him saying that

85
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,383
Over the next few years Dred and Harriet had

86
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,151
Two kids

87
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,431
Both of them girls

88
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,759
And I personally I think that that what happened was

89
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,551
Children seeing change everything

90
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,415
So what ends up happening is that

91
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,695
Dr. Emerson

92
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
Moves Dred Scott and his family

93
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
Back to

94
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,303
Missouri

95
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
They're back in the slave state

96
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,655
And dr. Emerson ends up passing away

97
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:37,055
And it seems like his wife is going to maybe sell Dred Scott's daughters

98
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,639
So what Dred and Harriet Scott end up

99
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,735
Deciding to do the whole reason we know Dred Scott's name

100
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,271
Is that they

101
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,575
Decide to sue for their own freedom

102
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,975
That's a lawsuit that Dred Scott had every right to believe that he would win

103
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,047
A Doctrine called once free always free

104
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:04,447
That the minute your foot landed in the snow of the north the minute to you and your owner walked

105
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:10,079
Mean to free territory you were free and you could not be returned

106
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,359
2 estate of bond

107
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
This was a well-known

108
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,551
Legal argument and impact Dred Scott one at a lower court so it goes all the way up to the Supreme Court

109
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,111
And the Supreme Court says

110
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
You're still property

111
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:31,071
And the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Roger Taney

112
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
The black man

113
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:37,983
Has no rights that the white man is bound to respect Tawny

114
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,055
Amazingly broad decision

115
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,871
Not only slammed the door on Dred Scott

116
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,175
He slams the door

117
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
On the potential

118
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,503
For any African-American

119
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,039
Free or not free

120
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
To ever have

121
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
Full citizenship

122
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,879
In this country

123
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:59,487
And at that point at I'm at the highest court of the land to make that decision

124
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,583
That was putting a. On sort of this overarching

125
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,471
Battle between the North and the South before slavery and abolition is and so

126
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
When this happens

127
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:19,967
Now you start seeing Civil War popping off

128
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:26,367
Now as far as Dred Scott the case

129
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,415
Is concerned speaking legally

130
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:35,071
The thirteenth and fourteenth amendments to come along and overturn it but like that lie like the black man has no rights

131
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:39,935
That a white man is bound to respect like you can't overturn that line and these days

132
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:46,335
As the pendulum swings and we see a rise in blatant

133
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
Overt

134
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:53,759
White nationalism and violence over statues

135
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:59,903
That line still hovers above at all

136
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
What's a pose

137
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:15,263
You're a direct descendant of that case of that history supposed to name is Scott who last name is

138
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,311
Tahani

139
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,335
What do you do with that

140
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:26,527
Tickling now like what do you do with that history do you ignore it is it not your problem or do you have

141
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,343
Address it if you do how

142
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,231
Coming up next after the break we walk into a hotel lobby in St Louis

143
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,559
And get an answer we just did not expect

144
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:54,175
More perfect will continue in a moment

145
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,287
This is more perfect I'm chat album Rod okay now we come to the reunions

146
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,639
As she was supporting the story producer Julia Longoria

147
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:31,039
A little Googling located a couple of Scot Tani descendants and then found out that they were actually planning

148
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,575
To meet up

149
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,647
To have this kind of historic Summit

150
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,975
Which was like we thought was bananas

151
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
So she went

152
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,607
It was bananas and as soon as she came back she sat down in the studio

153
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,911
And told Elie mystal and I all about it

154
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
So where to start

155
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,591
Viking stoves

156
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
I walked into this

157
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:00,991
Hilton Frontenac hotel in St Louis classic

158
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,807
Hotel Atrium with like a fairy

159
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Weird

160
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,367
Carpet pattern

161
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:12,767
And I walk in and it's like hello it's almost like a conference

162
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,047
Greeted by

163
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
The great great

164
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,887
Granddaughter Dred Scott

165
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:24,287
Literally this is our inaugural Sons and Daughters of reference

166
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,847
Association is the name Flynn Jackson

167
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:33,503
She's the main organizer this is always a dream that I had about 12 years ago

168
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,903
Then she immediately tells me I'm a network or I'm going to connect you with everyone

169
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,303
But I like doing invisible family right here and immediately she introduces me to these three people

170
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,703
Mimi Le Bourgeois John le Bourgeois family

171
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,751
The first family who owned

172
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:59,615
Her great-great-grandfather

173
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175
She also introduced me to the

174
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,295
Great great great

175
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:13,183
Grandson of Thomas Jefferson I meant Davis

176
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,231
A descendant of Jefferson Davis

177
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:21,631
You know the guy who led the Confederacy against the Union in the Civil War and everybody's hugging it

178
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:26,751
Laughing it was wild

179
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,543
Meaning of the utopian society

180
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
Exactly

181
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:37,759
And the whole idea everyone kind of wanted reconciliation reconciliation I was like

182
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:42,367
Reconciliation reconciliation

183
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:50,303
And so I'm wandering around and going up shaking hands with random people and then I meet the

184
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,143
This one guy

185
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
Yes

186
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:59,007
Dread Madison I am the great great grandson of Dred and Harriet Scott

187
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
And

188
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,567
I look in his eyes

189
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
And I was like

190
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,407
Holyshit

191
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,455
Those are Dred Scott size

192
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,063
I mean there's really only one picture of Dred Scott that exist

193
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
And

194
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,159
From around 1857 he's wearing a suit

195
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,951
Staring straight at the camera

196
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,767
And is either like almost glassy

197
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,071
Pupils are really big and it's

198
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
Striking

199
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,447
I felt like I was looking right into those same eyes

200
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,847
Have you always known that you're related to Dred Scott and magic and what it wants to relationships about his

201
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
History what are you when you think about it

202
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,919
What are you

203
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,455
Where you feel

204
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,759
I have mixed feelings

205
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
Based on what

206
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:51,487
He tested Tony said and the decision I made. You are subhuman species with no rights a white man is bound to respect

207
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:56,351
No rights that white men are bound to respect

208
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:06,079
What really hit me the hardest knife it is hard for me to even think about this cuz it did just bothers me

209
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:12,479
Who was the Trayvon Martin

210
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:20,927
Just keep walking home from my store what's my name wasn't breaking any laws someone decided to follow

211
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
Pull up on him

212
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,767
Any luck murderer

213
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,375
Big guy parked his car got out of his car invaded it show me a space

214
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,959
And murdered him and used the stand-your-ground law

215
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:38,335
Your ground is yours until I decide it's not

216
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:45,503
I mean just as he's about to shake hands for the first time with the family who owned his family

217
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,135
Arrogant

218
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,463
Did that all go through here but you know you have to approach people

219
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,791
The approach people for who they are you got that open mind

220
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:02,143
One of the most striking things I learned from Dred Scott Jr Jr Jr

221
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,007
And also from his sister Barbara I'm Barber mcgregory I'm Dred Scott's great-great-granddaughter

222
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:10,079
Is that the Dred Scott history was actually something that was kind of

223
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,615
From them it was

224
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
Oshkosh weather

225
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Because

226
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:17,247
The Dred Scott decision I don't know if you were understanding what that was

227
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,343
That that was the last straw that sparked the Civil War my dad

228
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
When they were growing up they had deaths

229
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,439
They couldn't tell anybody who they were

230
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
Related to

231
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:32,607
Your dad. Generation this was like a hundred years after the decision that generation a secret

232
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
That's his great-grandfather

233
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,191
His grandmother was Dred Scott's daughter

234
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,519
Dread junior junior told me that

235
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,543
His dad

236
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:45,151
Was actually partially raised by Dred Scott's daughters

237
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,687
Whose name was Lucy

238
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,991
Try to hide the fact in fact who told me she was

239
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,783
She might have been kind of mad when

240
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
Maya

241
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,391
Grandfather grandmother name my father Dred Scott because she was in hiding

242
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,695
You got to remember when she was

243
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,511
6 years old they would have hiding for 5 year

244
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
During the trial

245
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
Gardner sister

246
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,399
Is the whole basis a trial was

247
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,935
He didn't want his family split up

248
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,799
So when you lost the second appeal he sent the girls in the hiding

249
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,847
Because Steven want them towed away

250
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
So

251
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,199
Lizzy stayed pretty much Undercover

252
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,247
She lived in off a little

253
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,319
The room but she always had that the shades closed

254
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:31,231
So Jordan Barbara told me their parents never talked about Dred Scott I never had a picture up in the house

255
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,535
Never even knew what he looked like

256
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
In fact

257
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,191
As we were standing there in the lobby of the Hilton

258
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
Dread pulled out his phone

259
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,031
Photos of Dred Scott

260
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,615
Pictures of Dred Scott and he brings up

261
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:54,015
The photo on Google

262
00:16:54,271 --> 00:17:00,415
Things like this

263
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,695
Dark eyes

264
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,767
He's wearing a suit

265
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,863
Like he was impressed I think like you wouldn't expect to

266
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:14,751
Slave to be dressed so nice. The first time you seen the picture Dred Scott

267
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:21,151
But it seemed like he was noticing things in it for the first time looks really dignified and stirred in that

268
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:21,919
A picture

269
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:26,015
But he looks looks like a man who's going through it is ready to go to some more

270
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:54,431
Okay so at the end of the night I end up at the hotel bar with another sentence

271
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,247
No I thought what her is about

272
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,135
No I think you should answer that so the Dred Scott case is a famous

273
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,671
Supreme Court case

274
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,463
And the Chief Justice who

275
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,767
Real demon cases Roger Brooke Pine

276
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
So I'm at Sonic

277
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,703
Charlie tawney is the great great grand nephew of Rodger Brooke Taney who is the chief

278
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,775
Injustice 2 basically denied Dred Scott his freedom

279
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:27,199
Kind of a tall guy white hair glasses on tip of his nose

280
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:33,599
At 11 bath original copy that decision and he was actually sitting there

281
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:37,695
Next 2-3 descendants from the family who originally owned Red Sky

282
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,023
They're like come join us and so to my left is

283
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
The descendants of

284
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,935
The people who own Dred Scott into my right are the people who kept Dred Scott enslaved

285
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
Are you not going to eat one of those

286
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:57,151
And they're all just having gin and tonics and crab cakes

287
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:03,551
Past is never dead it's not even past

288
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:09,951
Can you describe the first images you saw of Tony eventually I steer the conversation

289
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:15,071
Back to Charlie Tanya's ancestor Roger Taney the Supreme Court Justice

290
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,399
We have pictures of him hanging on our house when I grew up in the house

291
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:22,751
It was up on the wall and it had that I remember it had this so late over it

292
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:27,871
Unlike the Dred Scott family Charlie Tony and his daughter Kate Kate taney Billingsley

293
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,711
Grep knowing exactly what Roger looks like his skin

294
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,271
Flopped over and he had these

295
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:39,647
Long jowls but he was also a thin man

296
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,975
He looks like

297
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:49,375
Shriveled up little old man who lives up in the house on the hill that hardly ever comes out of his house and all the kids are scared of

298
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,215
You grab them

299
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,543
When's the first time you study of the Civil War probably like fifth grade

300
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,567
Sixth grade

301
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:03,199
And you're like sliding down in your seat when I get to the Dred Scott decision because you know this is really terrible and that's

302
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:03,967
My family

303
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
Did that

304
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,783
So that you're very aware of it

305
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,623
And we're also I mean and we're also in a while while you're

306
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,999
Well that's a black mark on our family the also ran one of the most productive

307
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
The courts

308
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,839
During a time of explosive growth in the cut

309
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
She was very proud of his role

310
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,191
Helping form America

311
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:31,103
What is known for is the single worst decision ever made by the Supreme Court

312
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,175
If your family member it's it's

313
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:39,295
A little a little difficult to have that be the only focus

314
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,111
Sitting there it was pretty clear that Charlie Tawny was

315
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:47,487
Kind of like Dred Scott Madison he also had some mixed feelings still having red having red

316
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,047
Numbers as letters I think I think he was

317
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,351
I think he I think he really loved

318
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
Guaifenesin

319
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:57,983
Family and that he was a very loving father and he was against slavery

320
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,543
It's pretty clear he thought it was a blot on the national character

321
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,847
He thought slavery was wrong

322
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,175
Are we

323
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,247
He thought it was wrong and should have been chili be done away with

324
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,063
He told me that in one of his legal arguments Tani

325
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,647
Totally rails against slave drivers

326
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,208
These people are reptiles

327
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,256
Who deal in the traffic in a few minutes

328
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,096
Sitting there Charlie tells me that

329
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
Roger Taney was

330
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,192
Trying to save the Union

331
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,240
That somehow if

332
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,288
He ruled that America was

333
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
Luvocracy

334
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,336
Once and for all

335
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,128
That might somehow

336
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,944
Delay the Civil War was trying to solve

337
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,016
The issue of slavery in America that might be true but

338
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,808
You put you can't overlook this

339
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,088
Will you read that language

340
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
That he was

341
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
A stone racist

342
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
I just was

343
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
And

344
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,792
And I asked them

345
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,352
Like when you met the Scott

346
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,912
Like what did you feel like what did you

347
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:03,008
Did you feel like you wanted to communicate something to them and

348
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,056
The blow descendants

349
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,104
Family who originally owned Dred Scott

350
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
Sad

351
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,944
Yeah like we're sorry

352
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:16,064
Have you ever I turned it on Ian's it like have you ever actually apologized

353
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,648
He's like I don't know I don't know if I ever use those words

354
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,208
I don't recall ever using those words

355
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,264
How's the weather next day

356
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:42,432
Pikachu at The Forum about hundred people crammed into the Grand Ballroom of the Hilton

357
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
The preacher

358
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,344

Can you get like a little spiel about

370
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:38,752
Who they are what reconciliation means to them

371
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,288
Wife Martha

Is a half-sister of Sally hemings you might not know about their answer

373
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
They had the same father

374
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,760
And then after about 5 people have spoken

375
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,808
Please welcome to the stage

376
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
Charlie Tony Bennett

377
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
Morning

378
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,720
So the first thing I like to do is

379
00:23:59,232 --> 00:23:59,744
Toyota

380
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,560
Your honor

381
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,424
Let me start with Rodger pisani what it was like to grow

382
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:12,544
The grub is autonomy in terms of how we feel about him as a real it's a mixed bag

383
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
Because on the one hand

384
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,920
Azan you're proud

385
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
He was

386
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,272
Are the longest serving Chief justices

387
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,832
The Bible he swore Lincoln in with

388
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,624
President Obama

389
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,208
However

390
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
That's not what he's known for

391
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,792
What is known for its one thing

392
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,096
He's done for the Dred Scott decision

393
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,400
And just so we all

394
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,960
Want to get a handle on

395
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
Let me read your sentence

396
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
Shiro

397
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,456
Which is a painting at the time of the Constitution

398
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,064
That African-Americans here's the quote

399
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,880
For more than a century have been regarded as being

400
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,672
Open exterior order

401
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,144
Associate

402
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,192
So far.

403
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
They had no rights

404
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
Which white man was bound

405
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
Respect

406
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,552
You make me proud of him

407
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
You can talk that

408
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
So

409
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,352
I looked up reconciliation

410
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,960
The process of reconciliation

411
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,520
And their three stash

412
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,080
The first step is apology

413
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,408
The second step is forgiveness

414
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
And the third step is

415
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,760
A new crop

416
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:05,952
But some someone has Kate about this issue apology

417
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,792
Atonic bringing an apology

418
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
Scott

419
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,120
It's like bringing a Band-Aid to an amputation

420
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,448
It just is not enough

421
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,752
But he was like

422
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
You got to start somewhere

423
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,360
So let's let's make a little history

424
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,016
You have our apology

425
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,288
I spoke to Scott descendants afterwards

426
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:58,688
What was that what did you think of it very much more emotional than I thought

427
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:05,088
Great great granddaughter Barbara macgregory no one's ever apologize Clinton made an apology

428
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:08,928
Some years ago but coming from him

429
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,744
Didn't mean much but

430
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
When

431
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,560
Connie

432
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:20,960
Emotional when he was reading that letter that was more heartfelt to me then

433
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
Anything else

434
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:26,080
Whose apology was okay but but his emotion really touched me

435
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:30,176
Barbara the Dred Scott defendant was like when he choked up reading that

436
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,200
I could feel that

437
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:31,968
But that felt

438
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,272
Like healing

439
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,576
But you doing

440
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:42,976
Hello then I qualified her brother and I ask you what you're thinking about how did you respond to all that

441
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,256
Dred Scott Madison

442
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,792
The one with the eyes

443
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:52,448
Everything was fine it's just odd to be honest the last part hot Cheeto worth

444
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:58,848
I like it I don't think somebody should have to apologize for something I didn't do justice to answer

445
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:05,248
Chester. I just I was very uncomfortable with that that's the fact that they

446
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:11,648
They're here is apology enough apologizing for something your ancestor did your part of a gene pool

447
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,720
You judged by your works not someone else's

448
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,584
Show me that you care don't tell me that you're sorry

449
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
Show me that

450
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,400
You going to do better

451
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:28,800
That's the only comment I have on it

452
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:35,200
Couple final notes when we talk to Dred Scott Madison later

453
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,504
He was pretty clear that look Charlie Tawny

454
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:42,880
Is already doing a lot of good he's helping the Dred Scott Foundation to raise money

455
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:49,536
That's why he felt the Charlie didn't need to apologize also when we started the story they were statue

456
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:55,936
Pictures of Rodger Brooke Taney in Annapolis and in Baltimore both in front of courthouses

457
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,496
Actually how the Scots

458
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:02,080
One of the first ways they come together they had decided collectively

459
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:08,736
On a plan to amend those two statues rather than take them down they have decided to put a drill

460
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:15,136
Scott statue next to them and they've been working on it

461
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:21,536
Politicians that met with the mayor of Baltimore

462
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:27,936
Finishing up the story Charlottesville happened

463
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:34,336
In the wake of Charlottesville

464
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:40,736
Standing outside the Maryland State House in Annapolis

465
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:47,136
In Charlottesville Virginia Ghost Town

466
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:53,536
In the same way

467
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:03,520
And it was a golf clap when tati came off the pedestal here and was

468
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:09,920
Remove but other than that everybody was quiet nobody had an opinion on this to themselves

469
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:16,320
145 year history gone here tonight and I'll get out of the way this is all that's left this is the pedestal that is
