00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:05,888
WNYC Studios

2
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:10,496
Perfect the most perfect album final episode

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:13,568
For those of you who maybe you're just too I don't know why you would

4
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,848
We just be doing it on this one

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,896
Let's say you are what we are up to

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,432
Who is we are taking

7
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,992
The 27 amendments to the US Constitution

8
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,528
Stodgy words that are

9
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,296
Are so important

10
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,600
Define our rights as American

11
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,624
But they're so large

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,416
They are

13
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,184
We didn't

14
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,000
Even us who have been reporting on court cases

15
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:32,768
3 years

16
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,560
I had never read

17
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:38,912
Amendment 23 I just hadn't I hate I couldn't have told you what it is

18
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:43,008
So make a long story short we decided to put together an album

19
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,800
To reanimate

20
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,568
These

21
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:49,664
Crucially important words through the power of music and in the podcast

22
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,456
Raw from the liner notes

23
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,016
List of the songs were telling stories about these amendments about

24
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,296
Where they came from

25
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,832
What they mean to us now and we have

26
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,112
2 amendments left

27
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,648
Two songs

28
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,440
To go with each of those two amendments

29
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,000
And we will begin this final episode

30
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,792
With one I just mentioned

31
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
23rd Amendment

32
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,376
Presidential vote for DC

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,312
The district constituting the seat of government of the United States

34
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,640
Shall appoint in such manner is Congress made a wreck

35
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,968
The number of electors of President and Vice President

36
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
Equal to the whole number of Senators and representatives in Congress to which the district would be entitled if it were state

37
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,392
If it were state

38
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,416
David worst day

39
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,280
Okay we arrive at Amendment 23 all those words

40
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,328
Just a second ago with the amount due is simply this

41
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,120
23rd Amendment

42
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,168
Gives the citizens of

43
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,496
The District of Columbia the citizens of DC the right

44
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
To vote

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
For president

46
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
Which for me

47
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,592
Begs the question

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,664
DC didn't have the right to vote for president what

49
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,248
The White House is in DC for god sakes

50
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:01,856
How to take a 23 amendments to give the citizens of DC the right to vote for

51
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,976
Why Julie Longoria why and why don't they have that right in the first place

52
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,512
It was kind of an act

53
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
Didn't

54
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,376
Reason why this ended up happening is

55
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,912
The founders

56
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,192
Wanted to

57
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,472
Put the White House

58
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,264
In a neutral place

59
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,336
They wanted it to be outside of State politics

60
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,896
So you wouldn't run into a situation where like

61
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:29,504
The Civil War breaks out in the White House is in Alabama like what

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,064
What would Abraham Lincoln have done in that situation

63
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
We wanted to make sure

64
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,928
The capital would operate from a peaceful place of neutrality

65
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:43,328
So the founders took corners of Maryland and Virginia and created a city that would be controls

66
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
Buy conch

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,216
I don't think anyone meant to disenfranchise

68
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
All of the nearly

69
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,824
700000 citizens that live in DC

70
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,128
But that's what ended up happening

71
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,432
Because DC is not a state

72
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,248
The Constitution didn't really address it

73
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
Princeton

74
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,832
It didn't have electors in the Electoral College

75
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,744
Alexander Hamilton. Eventually we fix the representation problem in DC but that didn't come until

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
1961

77
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
Which amendment number 23

78
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
Crazy to that long

79
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:22,752
I did actually fix the problem in the end no actually all the 23rd Amendment did

80
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,568
Is give the citizens of DC the right to vote for

81
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
President

82
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
Which you know

83
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
Is no small thing but

84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,968
It left many things on answer

85
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,552
It didn't really clarify what DC is

86
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,368
Constitutionally like is it a city is it a state

87
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,160
The way our system of government work

88
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,488
You got to be part of a state to have senators

89
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,560
You got to be part of the state to have a vote in the house

90
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,376
DC is simultaneously

91
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
Not a state

92
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,168
Eat and not

93
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,448
Part of a bigger state

94
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,984
So it's

95
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,264
Definitely a thing

96
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,872
But it's like not enough of a thing to get it full representation in Congress

97
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
You don't have

98
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,712
A full democracy unless you treated equally

99
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,296
And a district is not treated equally because

100
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
We're the only jurisdiction

101
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,648
The pay federal taxes

102
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,464
I know whose member cannot vote

103
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,768
And whose member has no senator

104
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,583
And that's that's you you can't vote right

105
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
That's me

106
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:26,495
This is congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton and I represent the District of Columbia Nations Cafe

107
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,335
She kind of sits at the center of the blind spot of

108
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,615
The 23rd Amendment

109
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,383
She's

110
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,175
The non-voting delegate

111
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,759
From Washington DC I'm called a delegate I'm

112
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039
Just like my

113
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:44,671
Pearson called delegates so sorry at what what is a non-voting delegate what is that

114
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,719
Kind of what it sounds like like it

115
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,559
A congress person who represents their constituents in Congress

116
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:55,167
They have an office in Congress does all the things that normal Congress people do

117
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,495
But when it comes time for the final vote on the floor

118
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,031
They don't have it

119
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,823
They don't have a vote

120
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,663
Why isn't the whole reason you elected Congress person so they can go to DC and vote on bills

121
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
Yeah

122
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
Over the years there have been

123
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:14,111
Over 150 proposals to change this ideally Eleanor wants

124
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,439
To solve it by making DC the 51st state of the United

125
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,231
But it's become like this

126
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,767
Political thing where like

127
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,559
DC is

128
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,351
Berry Blue as a city

129
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:31,007
It's also 47% African-American what's happened over the years is that some Republicans have found ways to block

130
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
Eleanor Holmes Norton zafords

131
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
To get representation

132
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
Some people say

133
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,151
It would be unconstitutional

134
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:43,807
A huge disappointment to me but very frankly I'm used to uphill battle so you can get yourself together

135
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,879
Everything to know about Eleanor Holmes Norton

136
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Is that

137
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,183
Long before she was

138
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,975
The congresswoman from DC

139
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:57,887
She was a civil rights activist

140
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:04,287
Give me organizer with the Mississippi Freedom Summer in the 1960s equality

141
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Is not

142
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:09,151
Brain part of this

143
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,967
I'm almost any other diverse Style

144

Amazon made a show about the lawsuit she won for young women researchers at Newsweek the idea of women's

145
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,023
Yesterday

146
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,607
When she was a lawyer at the ACLU she won a historic

147
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
First Amendment case

148
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
Where she represented

149
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
White Nash

150
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
Sometime

151
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
I got the same people

152
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Who

153
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
Would not defend me

154
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:45,759
The woman is fascinating she was the first woman to head the EOC the equal employment opportunity commission

155
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:50,367
I'm wrote the first federal guidelines that helps make sexual harassment

Illegal

Under federal law

158
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,207
And Eleanor Holmes Norton

159
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,023
Leather push that Anita Hill could even be her

160
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,143
She was one of the people who demanded that Anita Hill be able to testify before the Senate like

161
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,727
She is a revolutionary

162
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
Invite

163
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,311

Thank you so much

165
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895

This ship

Soon I hope to have a real name

175
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,167
The day we visited her she was speaking at an event

176
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
At the Wharf

177
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,239

When

183
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,759
And I know politicians have to do that sort of thing that's rain

184
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,623
But the juxtaposition of the Revolutionary I read about and go

Who sale

188
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
Her

189
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,607
Boise smacking a staff against the yellow Water Taxi

190
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
It was

191
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,495
Confusing

192
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
You've been doing this

193
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
For a long time right

194
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,919
Since 91 and I'm curious

195
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,015
You had a really varied career you know you've

196
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:28,671
I watch the Amazon special that's mostly based on your life and and you were the first woman

197
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,487
I wonder why you made the turn

198
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,815
To be in this position where your hands are tied

199
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,143
Ironically my hands are tied in the least

200
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
Can't

201
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,471
Do

202
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:47,103
The final vote but by the time the final vote comes in the house it's a done deal so I have to

203
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,407
I have to do the work

204
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,455
Ahead of time which is what every member

205
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,247
Even those we have the vote

206
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,087
I have to do it made things even more confusing

207
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,391
Is that she insisted that even though she

208
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
He cannot vote

209
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
Her job is no different than any of her colleagues

210
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,023
I go to the house floor

211
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:10,143
Like everybody else I work in committee where most of the work is being done

212
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,191
I go and

213
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,775
Talk to two members of the Senate and and it kept coming up

214
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:22,175
She kept harping on that point my job is no different than I do what everybody else says if you want to get a bill passed

215
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,711
At one point

216
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,783
She got really upset with us

217
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:35,231
Because we made the mistake of comparing the situation of DC to the territory

218
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,815
Which also don't have voting representation in Congress

219
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:43,167
Places like Puerto Rico and Guam are completely different places

220
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,751
It seems almost like an insult to her to ask questions about

221
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,567
This thing which seems so obviously true

222
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
The every single respect

223
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,943
Accept not having the final vote on the house floor

224
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,991
We are a state

225
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
Wheezing

226
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,767
The irony of this comes out almost cartoonishly when depressed person

227
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:15,167
That we talked to was in the room band yet told us that there was this buzzer that goes off in the office when there's a vote on the house floor

228
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:20,543
Ben was telling me about a sound that happens when there's a voter's me like that with

229
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,847
So what is that I don't know what that is

230
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
What is what

231
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
Now there's a boat

232
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,319
When you hear the Bell you know there's about in this

233
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,903
Born shoes that you have 15 minutes

234
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
To go to the floor

235
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
Ornette signal

236
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,375
Whether to vote on the rule on something else

237
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,727
So that is supposed to Signal like that your butt over there kind of thing

238
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,543
It does mean that

239
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,103
If you have a boat you should be preparing to go

240
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
About

241
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
And for you to

242
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
What is that what does that

243
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,271
Signal to your house that beat make you feel

244
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:06,111
What that may mean I've been on the floor ready to discuss the bill

245
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:11,231
I can discuss any Bill including pills I can vote on which is which is the most bills

246
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Withdrawal bill

247
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
Going to the floor

248
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,983
Speak on the bill I'll be going to the floor to speak on the FAA

249
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,311
I didn't know how to make sense of this irony

250
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
This woman

251
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Who's been

252
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,663
Representing disempowered people

253
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
All her life

254
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
She's almost

255
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,039
Choosing to be in a role with virtually no power

256
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,343
And then insisting in these moments

257
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
That she's not disempowered at all

258
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,231
If I were going to demand change it seems like

259
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,023
I would shout from the rooftops

260
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
I don't have a vote

261
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,399
That my job is completely different that I'm completely disempowered

262
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,191
In these moments

263
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,239
Eleanor Holmes Norton had almost

264
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:58,335
Is willful denial of the miserable situation that DC finds

265
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
It's open

266
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
I only had about 15 minutes

267
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
Congresswoman Norton

268
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,503
And I went home from DC totally baffled

269
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
By the interaction

270
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,087
So I started

271
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,391
Looking back at her speeches and her writings

272
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
Deep

273
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
Deep

274
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,975
Cuts on C-Span

275
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:19,583
And I found this one panel from 1987 at the Sag Harbor initiative

276
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
What was called

277
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,655
The Retreat from equality

278
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
And it clarified things for me

279
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,055
I do want to say something about the Constitution

280
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
Southern Marshall

281
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,919
Did a great service to the country

282
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,503
Remind

283
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,343
Thurgood Marshall

284
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,879
Reminding it that

285
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,303
Of our own Constitution

286
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:56,703
But it is very important.

287
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:02,079
Powerful myth

288
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:09,247
One of the only remaining powerful meth

289
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,039
Is the myth of the concert

290
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
The Mist

291
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:19,743
Whatever our religious or ethnic

292
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,071
Powerful men

293
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,983
Has not always been

294
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,311
Is true

295
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,359
For those who believe in God

296
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:42,271
Even when there is war and famine and pestilence

297
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:47,135
They can indeed live

298
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,439
Of the concert

299
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:54,559
Is in a very real sense

300
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,167
When there was nothing but racism

301
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,751
They believe those words

302
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,823
Call Babe

303
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,919
They ultimately made the black people there for

304
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
How to be

305
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,039
At the Forefront of those who celebrate

306
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
The

307
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,367
Not because it is perfect

308
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,695
Because they have made it more perfect

309
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,279
One of the worst things we could do in a Time

310
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
When so little

311
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,119
Brings us together

312
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,959
Try to debunk or destroy

313
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,775
Powerful myth

314
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,359
Anime

315
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,919
Of the Great American Constitution

316
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,991
Which has been copied all over the world

317
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,575
And which continues to drive up to a more perfect Society

318
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951
In some ways I think

319
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
Eleanor Holmes Norton

320
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,511
China stands in 4D

321
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
DC

322
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
She lives in a

323
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
State

324
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,119
A suspended denial

325
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,911
In order to keep fighting

326
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,471
If she were

327
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:10,847
Black people or women or any of the people were not in the original We the People

328
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:14,431
If we ever succumb to our powerlessness gave up

329
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,711
It would all be over

330
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,575
But if Eleanor Holmes Norton keeps believing in the Constitution

331
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:25,439
Believing in the myth that it tells us the myth of her own power despite the odds

332
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,767
Despite even the reality of her situation

333
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Maybe

334
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,583
She can make her reality

335
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
Match the myth

336
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,823
I mean hey we got the 23rd Amendment didn't we

337
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:54,623
Has Julia Longoria with

338
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,927
That liner notes for the 23rd Amendment

339
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
As for the album

340
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
We asked

341
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,559
Students at Duke Ellington School of the Arts

342
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,607
The song for us

343
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
23rd Amendment

344
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:13,055
The song is written and arranged by their teacher in the classroom

345
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,383
Performance is great at the most perfect album. Org

346
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
Jordis

347
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,991
Duke Ellington School of the Arts

348
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:02,111
That was sort of an edited version of a song they put together for us for the 23rd Amendment

349
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:07,231
You can hear the entire thing and see the entire thing is well at the most perfect album. Org

350
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,047
I'm Jedi Cam'ron We will return in a minute

351
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
This is more perfect time chat at home run

352
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,031
Okay so here we are

353
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,663
At the Finish Line the very last of the amendments to the US Constitution 27

354
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,711
When we started this project

355
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,503
Most of us hear more perfect

356
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
Didn't know

357
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
How many amendments

358
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,111
Exactly

359
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
What each of the men

360
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
Now we do

361
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
More importantly

362
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,023
We picked the name

363
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,583
2017 clue the number in the name

364
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,375
27 most perfect album

365
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,447
Because while we were making it we realized this project

366
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,495
Is a kind of time

367
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,055
Right now there are 27 Amendments

368
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,591
One day

369
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,895
They'll be 28

370
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,735
1029

371
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:07,647
Because clearly we have not yet gotten to that more perfect union and each one of these amendments represents a Time

372
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,207
We try to fix something in ourselves

373
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
This project is a testament

374
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
A love letter really

375
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
To that willingness

376
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,983
To change your thinking of

377
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:28,383
This album is serving emotional musical snapshot of who we are as a nation right now

378
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,711
Who is your trying to become

379
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:37,599
So it's fitting that I last line or notice

380
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,671
Short it's really about that

381
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,767
Kevin Devine the artist who wrote about the 27th Amendment for us

382
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,839
Tells the story of one guy

383
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,375
Spent 10 years

384
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,703
Trying to get two-thirds of both houses 3/4 of the states

385
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,239
To ratify an amendment

386
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,823
It had been written almost 200 years earlier

387
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
So I got the 27th Amendment

388
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,455
For this project 27th Amendment

389
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,247
Congressional compensation

390
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:11,135
No law varying the compensation for the services of the senators and representatives shall take effect

391
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,207
Until an election of Representatives shall have intervened

392
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,303
Just basically says the Congress can't give itself a raise in the end it's sitting term

393
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
GZA sound sensible thing

394
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:27,519
Apparently brought forth in the 1789 and then not ratified until 1992 which is by

395
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,591
190 years or something the longest margin

396
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:38,527
And the story the people I was interested in where this college kid in the early 80s you write some papers

397
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
Saying that

398
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,367
She believes that they could still be ratified

399
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,415
And his teacher gives him a seat

400
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,767
Intazza Mike there's no way that could be true

401
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,351
And then the sky kind of makes it like his bow know we kind of like

402
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,887
Thanks drum about it for 10 years

403
00:20:54,399 --> 00:21:00,543
Mission

404
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,847
It gets

405
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,919
Resurrected and eventually

406
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:13,087
38th state to vote to ratify was Michigan in his speech the

407
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,159
Guy who sang the gavel and made it so

408
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,440
Said that

409
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:23,072
Something's take a year round here but others take a little more like 200

410
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:28,192
Minecraft pasteurize that for the first one of the songs I thought it was a really good entry point

411
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,752
And I've got a kick out of it a lifelong

412
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,568
Northeasterner family here in Jersey

413
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:37,920
Jersey was in line to be the ratifying votes

414
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,224
Michigan took it out of their hands

415
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,624
So one more bridesmaid moment for my people in New Jersey

416
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,672
Why

417
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
So that's it

418
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:58,656
7 past midnight

419
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,736
Kevin Devine with the 27th

420
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
Closing out

421
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
The most perfect album

422
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,088
Okay before we go

423
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,136
If 27 is just a moment

424
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
Anime

425
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
It's not the most exciting

426
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
King of the amendment

427
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,048
Silly there are more to come there must be more to come we need more

428
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,352
Just wanted for second as we go out

429
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,912
What will be 28

430
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:37,568
We all know we need a 28th Amendment

431
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:43,968
I'm not proposing a 28th amendment that 28th Amendment

432
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:50,368
Members of Congress Constitutional Amendment

433
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:56,768
Reasonable limits on Election spending around

434
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:09,568
Whatever ends up

435
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:15,968
Add song to the album if you make a whole new album until then more perfect is produced by me

436
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:22,368
Julie Longoria Kelly Prime sarkari and Alex overington withheld from Elie mystal Michelle

437
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:28,768
David Gable all truly amazing people I could not be more grateful to them all including NorCal

440
