WNYC Studio

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,432
Our story today starts couple years back

4
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,968
On February 26th

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,504
2014

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,040
Washington DC

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,160
You know we we got up very early that morning

8
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:31,232
This is February I believe so it's pretty cold

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,560
And I tell you we were sitting there

10
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,376
Announcer the cavernous

11
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,936
You know empty Metro station rehearsing

12
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:43,776
Guy says he has been Ryan Clayton went through what they're about to do over

13
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,312
And over and over

14
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:49,664
It was very helpful to serve go through go through and go through it

15
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:54,272
Two incomes to help on a train ticket a couple stops

16
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Get out walk

17
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:57,856
Blocks

18
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,416
Crosby Street and then walk

19
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,952
Up the marble steps

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,536
Supreme Court and then we have to wait in line

21
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,584
Get through security

22
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,144
And you're trying you know you're trying to just be

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,520
Be cool once they're inside they pretend not to know each other and then you know you get brought into the chamber

24
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,872
My first time ever being inside

25
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,944
They take their seats in The Spectator section

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,968
Look around

27
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,504
And it's such a grand

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,064
Kind of intimidating

29
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,088
Space

30
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,208
There are these red velvet curtains

31
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
The back

32
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,768
If you look up marble

33
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,536
Carvings

34
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,816
On the

35
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,864
The walls and the ceiling

36
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,728
And on the North and South walls there are these huge portraits

37
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,520
Great lawmakers through history

38
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,544
Moses

39
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
Hammurabi

40
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,616
John Marshall Muhammad

41
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
So I was just taking all of that in

42
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,224
Feeling feeling the butterflies

43
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,040
And I had to send

44
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,600
That it was very much doable

45
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
Avengers just waiting

46
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,488
Eventually the court-martial comes out says a few words

47
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
About how it works

48
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,536
When you're in there and not

49
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,584
Speaking so on and then finally

50
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,400
The nine justices enter the room

51
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,704
Almost like priest on a cloud

52
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
The robes

53
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,312
Whispering around them at that point tried to meditate son just

54
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:27,712
Be smart and stay cool and then Chief Justice John Roberts speaks

55
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:34,368
1211 84 octane Fitness vs icon Health & Fitness Incorporated

56
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:39,232
In case case self is not important

57
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:44,864
A florist make their arguments or no further questions your honor side Orchard to a pharmacy

58
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,448
Thank you, so that's all Ryan make his motion and I was just

59
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
That point just sort of thing

60
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,312
Like the practice in the sense of Readiness in

61
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,640
You know a little bit of sort of rock and roll Han Solo spirit

62
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
You know just say like

63
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,968
It's game time but you got to do this thing

64
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
And I stood and said

65
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:07,648
I rise on behalf of the vast majority of the American people who believe that money is not speech

66
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:14,048
And that our democracy should not be for sale

67
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
I saw the security coming towards me from the left and like people getting up and I'm so depressed

68
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:26,848
Dashing through the chairs protected me from behind a Medicare hug me and then pulled me back

69
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
To those people

70
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,808
Kai Newkirk was arrested he spent the night in jail

71
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,368
Later pled guilty to three misdemeanor charges

72
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,416
But no one had noticed Ryan

73
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,536
No one had noticed they were together that Ryan had secretly videotape the entire episode

74
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,376
So when D-Day session was over and Ryan went home

75
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,912
And posted the video on YouTube

76
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,472
The story

77
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:59,872
Just went crazy

78
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,688
To the role of money in politics

79
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,344
Because almost no Outsider had ever gotten a camera into the court supposed to happen

80
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,744
Antonio cameras are banned from the court

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,303
Highest court in second Bill Gaul

82
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,839
The gall

83
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,959
Of someone to walk into that esteemed chamber and do that to those esteemed justices

84
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
And by the way

85
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,799
Just once

86
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:35,199
Still hear arguments first this morning in case 1313 to know the Supreme Court action that we didn't February 2014 was the

87
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
First but not the last

88
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
Thank you Miss

89
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Chief justice

90
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:42,367
There's a fifth anniversary of citizens united there were seven people who did as destruction

91
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:48,767
This is from January

92
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,583
21st 2015

93
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:57,471
Security again rounds of protesters

94
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:04,127
Chief justice Roberts tries to laugh it off please

95
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,431
The same gun you can sort of hear Justice Ginsburg

96
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:12,831
Trying to figure out like how many how many protesters are in the room

97
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
Over the next

98
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
You're so

99
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,231
We did

100
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,767
More actions next one

101
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,095
April 1st 2015

102
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
See if there's another

103
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
Justices Scalia and Thomas murmuring to each other

104
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Please

105
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,831
Can you adjust the time I say I think that's the same dude is the last time

106
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,655
Kind of hard to hear over the yelling at you can sort of hear Justice Scalia lean over to Thomas and say we should throw these people in jail face

107
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
Anyone else interested in talking will be admonished that it's within the authority of this court to punish such disturbances by

108
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
My criminal contempt

109
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
Optari

110
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
You do it

111
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:23,487
So here's why we started the story this way over and over again the protesters call out one case

112
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,303
20 most controversial cases in American history

113
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
It was decided on January 21st

114
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
2010

115
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,495
To a good chunk of America that was the day that corporations

116
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,895
To control of American democracy

117
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,967
It is the Dark Ages

118
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:50,367
It is our Dred Scott I would suggest a

119
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
Revolution

120
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,999
But a revolution against the corporation the corporations that make all the guns and the bullets

121
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:02,399
Get rid of citizens united and its pernicious effect on our electoral system

122
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
One of the worst

123
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,495
Supreme Court decisions ever

124
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:11,615
Position of the United States Supreme Court in the 21st century

125
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
So this season of more perfect

126
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,063
We're rethinking a lot of the most hated Supreme Court decisions in this one citizens united is definitely that

127
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,231
It is widely Lowe's across the political Spectrum

128
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791
We got curious

129
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,375
Why why is it hated so much what exactly is

130
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,239
Why was it decided the way it was decided that turns out that last question

131
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,799
Gives you a unique window

132
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,895
Did not just how the Supreme Court works but Inside the Mind

133
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,735
Of arguably the most powerful man in America

134
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
Rihanna

135
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,135
Set up the Supreme Court of the United

136
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:08,959
Supreme Court of the United States

137
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:14,079
United States

138
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:37,631
Okay so the story of citizens

139
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
United

140
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:45,311
Begins with a landmark film from the corridor

141
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:51,711
A small town America

142
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:56,575
And I have mores some people call you in a week

143
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
I call you my base

144
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:02,463
It is summer 2004 commercials for Fahrenheit 911 are all over the place

145
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
The true story

146
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:10,143
And if you've seen documentary you know it's very critical of then-president

147
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
George W bush

148
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,495
For leading America into war based on

149
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
False intelligence

150
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,103
In the commercials when you looked at them they they came across this highway

151
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,175
Political and in highly effective

152
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,759
This is Michael Bowes he's one of the 3 B's

153
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
Important to the story

154
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,159
Know at the time that he was seeing these ads to his eye they came across as a

155
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,463
Especially political because at the time

156
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,791
As president I'll said if you clear a national priority

157
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Is for America

158
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,095
Over the past 3 years

159
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,655
American two-faced miniseries challenges

160
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,679
That summer

161
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:50,079
George W Bush was in a tight race with the Democratic nominee John Kerry which direction would John Kerry lead

162
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,615
Your actual political ads

163
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
George Bush's mistress

164
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,455
We're running wall-to-wall

165
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
John Kerry has

166
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
Weapons

167
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:06,207
Nearest country to ask for Fahrenheit 911 to do everything they can

168
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
Music did

169
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Kind of

170
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:15,167
It kind of Blended right in

171
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
Fahrenheit 911

172
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215
Late July

173
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,751
This is David bossie

174
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,079
Be number two in an interview that he gave to C-SPAN

175
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:27,967
I decided over the couple of weeks that Fahrenheit was out there that it just was having a lot bigger impact than

176
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
Even I wanted to admit

177
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,855
To this day Fahrenheit 911 is the top grossing documentary of all time

178
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:39,743
Inn at Summer of 2004 when the film was out bows and bossy were like a George Bush's down in the polls

179
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,279
This film has something to do with it

180
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,375
Italy decided to produce a documentary film

181
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Bad

182
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
Essentially counters

183
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,239
Fahrenheit 911

184
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:56,895
The weed that he's talking about is the conservative nonprofit the embassy run

185
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,431
Called surprise surprise

186
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
Citizens united

187
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,551
David bossie B2 is the chairman and president of citizens united

188
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,391
Michael Busby one vice president and the general

189
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
And just for contacts

190
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
The guy started

191
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,255
Citizens united

192
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:16,863
Is behind one of the most devastating political ads

193
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,423
Of all time

194
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,495
Bush supports the death penalty for first-degree murder

195
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:28,639
Dukakis not only opposes the death penalty be allowed first-degree murderers to have weekend passes from prison

196
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,455
The Willie Horton ad in 1988

197
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,527
Prettymuch tank Michael Dukakis presidential campaign

198
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
Daniel

199
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,487
After Bo's embossing saw how successful Fahrenheit 9/11 was and more importantly

200
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,303
How much precious airtime the movie Zathura

201
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
They thought

202
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,679
Let's do this we went out and we found

203
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:58,079
The best filmmakers in Hollywood they could do this let's make a movie

204
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
Who produced it

205
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,175
It was called Celsius 4111

206
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,247
The temperature at which the brain begins to die

207
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,319
You know liberal rain seduced by

208
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,135
Michael Moore's movie and then we wanted to run

209
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
Television ads

210
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,695
Promote that

211
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
But

212
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
We run into that problem

213
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
A big fat

214
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Problem

215
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,887
The f

216
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
E

217
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:29,055
The Federal Election Commission which by the way was created in 9

218
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,127
1974 after

219
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
Shearwater Bay

220
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,271
We're basically

221
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:42,367
You had campaign money

222
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Funding

223
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
A crime

224
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:52,863
Okay to the FEC came about post-watergate to basically regulate money and election

225
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
Money from corrupting policy

226
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:59,519
And he was like

227
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
Look your ads

228
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
Do not qualify

229
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Can't do it

230
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:08,223
Cuz even though you are a non-profit you cannot use your corporate piggy bank IE your Treasury

231
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,879
To put ads on the air cuz remember that law do we have John McCain won his battle for campaign Finance

232
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:18,463
Form the 2002 bipartisan campaign Reform Act

233
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,255
Also known as mccain-feingold

234
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
Restrict

235
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
The use of corporate money directly

236
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,351
Before our guests Kennedy

237
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:28,703
Medela Avicii said if you ran ads you would be violating that law

238
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,495
Which boss eb-2 was like

239
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,775
Hey wait a minute

240
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,359
This guy is running TV commercials

241
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:39,199
Which in my opinion were a lot better than John Kerry's commercial

242
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
Trying to make George Bush look bad

243
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:46,623
Why the F does he get to run ads we don't

244
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,671
The fcc's responses like

245
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
He's

246
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
Media

247
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:55,327
You can run ads on TV because he gets a media exemption you

248
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
You're not media

249
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
U-Haul corporate

250
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,935
So at that point in time

251
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
We decided

252
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,287
That we would get in the documentary filmmaking business

253
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,943
So citizens united producers broken promises the United Nations at 60

254
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,551
It's very difficult for Outsiders to understand about the UN has how ill-prepared and untrained most of

255
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
Sapphire

256
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
2006

257
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:23,231
Border War the battle over illegal immigration

258
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:29,631
That same year

259
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
Basic children

260
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,703
Mapreduce ACLU

261
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
At war with America

262
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,311
Goodbye 2008

263
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,615
We had a substantial history

264
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,687
Of making documentary films that we had made

265
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
Over that period of time

266
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,015
Several have won awards

267
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:51,135
Any of that's word to January 2008 United States is heading into another presidential

268
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,231
Election in the two candidates on the Democratic side

269
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,535
Barack Obama

270
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,583
Of course Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama

271
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,935
Citizens united Productions that's their nonprofit movie production wing

272
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
Made a new phone

273
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,239
Vindictive

274
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
Avenal

275
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,079
Ideological

276
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,919
Intolerant

277
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,223
Super subtle it's called Hillary

278
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,783
The movie she is

279
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
Steeped in Comfort

280
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
Mercy steep

281
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
Insley

282
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:28,767
Guess what we faced the same obstacle that we faced in 2004

283
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,071
Bows and bossy you can make the movie

284
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,887
You just can't let anyone know it exist

285
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,471
I was forbidden to advertise

286
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,311
Again this was because of mccain-feingold advertisements paid for with

287
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,663
Corporate money couldn't go on TV or on the radio 30 to 60 days

288
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,991
Before an election or Primary School don't understand

289
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,783
Mccain-feingold

290
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,087
Criminalizing political speech

291
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,159
My lawyer told me I would be

292
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
Indicted

293
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,511
And put in prison for five years

294
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
/

295
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
Count

296
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,631
Meaning every time they found a violation I could be put in for

297
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
It's so so

298
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,263
We decided to not let the FEC the Federal Election Commission

299
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,287
Come for us

300
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
We actually sued that

301
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Razoo

302
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
Where are we Sue

303
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,919
This is Jim Bob

304
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
B3

305
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,503
He is in Indiana bass campaign Finance

306
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:30,463
Thank you mister chief justice and may it please the court case to Federal Court

307
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
We lost

308
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
They lost

309
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,815
They appeal

310
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
Direct me to the Supreme Court

311
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:42,751
And Wallah will hear arguments today in case you're awake 205 Citizens United versus the federal election

312
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
Commission

313
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,103
Right so we're in the courtroom now

314
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Bright

315
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,943
Participation in the political process

316
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,735
Eastbay

317
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,807
Unsurprising argument

318
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:00,671
This is journalist and author Marcia Coyle she says you had the lawyer for the bees

319
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:07,071
Taking a very strong position by not allowing us to run our ads for Hillary the movie

320
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,655
It's wrong and you're violating our first amendment rights

321
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,959
In the case that you consider today

322
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,495
It is a felony

323
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,311
For a small nonprofit corporation

324
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,615
To offer interested viewers

325
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,687
In 90 minutes

326
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,759
90 minutes documentary

327
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:30,367
90 minute documentary 90-minute documentary

328
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:36,255
A 90-minute documentary documentary

329
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
90 minutes

330
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,351
90 minute documentary

331
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:46,751
90 minute documentary documentary

332
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,799
90 minutes documentary

333
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:55,199
90 minute documentary when you hear a certain word over and over and over it just turns into mush

334
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:01,855
90 minute documentary documentary it happens all the time when you listen to Supreme Court or are

335
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,927
Argument documentary

336
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,231
It is opening statement Ted Olson

337
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
Said that word

338
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,327
Documentary anytime

339
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:17,727
It just started to sound so weird but the point he was trying to make by saying it again and again and again

340
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,519
Is it citizens united

341
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,079
Was making a documentary

342
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,151
Things that are important to the public they were not

343
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
Quote

344
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:30,527
Oceaneering electioneering

345
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,367
It's another hour to hear over and over again music

346
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,975
But what it means is like camping advocacy and there are certain words

347
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,791
Eight of them actually words and phrases like vote

348
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
4

349
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Elect

350
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
Support

351
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,935
Cast your ballot for vote against

352
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
Defeat

353
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
Reject

354
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:54,079
Those words are the functional equivalent of those words according to the court

355
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,919
Suddenly make something advocacy electioneering and therefore

356
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
Regulated

357
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,343
But citizens united said look this is a movie about Hillary Clinton in a we don't say Vote or don't vote

358
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,463
Sold on DVDs

359
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,743
We're trying to

360
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:16,095
Disseminate the movie to an independent fire who will then offer it

361
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:22,495
They threw HBO movie

362
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,775
Definition of robust

363
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
Uninhibited debate

364
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,639
About a subject of intense political interest

365
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,175
Set the First Amendment

366
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,199
Is there

367
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
To guarantee

368
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
Is there elephants the film

369
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,415
Pretend liberal justices like David souter were like

370
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:45,791
Come on really a government's brief over open up ages 18 and 19

371
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
What's a quotation

372
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:56,031
Do anything

373
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,199
Qualifications not qualified as Commanders

374
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:11,135
A long discussion

375
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,671
Of the record

376
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,207
Qualification

377
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:20,607
History and conduct of someone who was in the political Arena so they go back and forth for a while

378
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:27,007
Was citizens united just making an elaborate campaign ad

379
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,543
The distinction between the 10-second

380
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311
Commercial

381
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,591
And say the 90 minutes

382
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,359
Infomercial

383
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:35,711
Like how can you tell is it about length is about who's doing the speaking blah blah blah

384
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,271
As Marshall said this part of the argument

385
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
Unsurprising

386
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
Thank you counsel

387
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
Then

388
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
The government

389
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
I got time to do justice

390
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,583
And made it please the court and this is where things really start

391
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,351
My turn

392
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:58,495
So the government lawyer Malcolm Stewart gets up there and he says these ads for this movie and this movie

393
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
Are clearly

394
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,079
Come on

395
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,663
The court should find an ad is the functional equivalent of Express advocacy

396
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,247
Only if the baddest acceptable of no reasonable interpretation

397
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,551
Appeal to vote for or against

398
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:18,208
Pacific candidate that's a very complicated way of saying if you watch the damn movie it you just can tell it looks like an addict

399
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:23,072
It smells like an added to that in the past the candidates would have

400
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,864
Are frenchtons 3 minutes

401
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
Infamous

402
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,424
So that's all fine and good but then

403
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,472
Walmart heirs and advertising

404
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,752
If it says we have

405
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,824
Candidate action figures for sale come by them

406
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,224
That counts as an electioneering communication place at the right time that would be covered

407
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,064
Chief justice Roberts

408
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
Required

409
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,368
Congress to draw the line work

410
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
Lessor testing malkin-stuart probing

411
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,280
How far the government can go

412
00:21:54,304 --> 00:22:00,192
Like if the government is allowed to say like that thing you're doing is an ad therefore it should be taken off the air at certain times

413
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
Where's the limit to that

414
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:06,336
Like what if the add as the government defines it is in

415
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:11,712
DVD or a buck canadain just yank those away to the Constitution permit

416
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:16,832
The Restriction of all of those as well

417
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,904
Apply the electioneering communication restrictions

418
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:27,840
And it's here where like you almost here the conservative justices be like

419
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,216
A book was published

420
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,032
Campaign biography that was

421
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,312
The functional equivalent of

422
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,592
Express advocacy

423
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,128
All that could be ban

424
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,456
I'm not so you could be bad I'm saying that Congress could prohibit

425
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:47,808
The use of corporate treasury bonds and could require a corporate

426
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,832
Name

427
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,392
One use of the candidates name

428
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
It would be covered

429
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,952
Correct

430
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,768
500 page book

431
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,584
Vote for

432
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,656
The government could ban there

433
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,240
Look at search for exit would be Express advocacy

434
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:12,640
And it would be covered by the federal election campaign act at this point

435
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,456
Out of this trap Springs

436
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:21,856
First Amendment protections

437
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,160
Question is obviously

438
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:30,560
Not presented here

439
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,888
The back down your position is the time of the Constitution

440
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:40,288
The advertising for this book

441
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,128
The book contains the functional equivalent of Express advocacy

442
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,408
What happens is

443
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:48,992
They eventually get him to say

444
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,808
And at the end it says

445
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,832
Vote for

446
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
X

447
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:59,744
Yes or position would be that the corporation could be required to use pack funds rather than General Treasury

448
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,120
If it didn't we could prohibit the publication of the book you mean the government

449
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,424
Kanban books

450
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:16,896
Being ate out in the courtroom and hearing that answer well it was stunned silence

451
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,456
Best kimbap b3v idea

452
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,272
That

453
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,320
Anything the government could do

454
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,624
Could amount to Banning a book

455
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:31,744
You know sent a shockwave through the courtroom and that's Jeffrey toobin from The New Yorker

456
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,816
He was also in the audience that day deep dark

457
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
Kind of

458
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
Secret

459
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,912
It was now exposed to the

460
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
To the light a day to the public

461
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,008
Did they really were in the book Banning

462
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,544
Book burning

463
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
Business

464
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,128
The question of the book

465
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,664
Underlines

466
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:54,272
How difficult it is when the government gets into regulating

467
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
A political speech

468
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
Jim

469
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:03,232
Malcolm Stewart kept protesting like no no no no no you're not understanding

470
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
Could prohibit

471
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:10,656
Did use of corporate treasury bond is not about banning political speech it's about regulating the money

472
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:17,056
Used to make that speech cuz if we don't sometimes do that some voices will be way too loud but okay that's

473
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,592
You know that's a find

474
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
Fiction

475
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,896
In the minds of the average

476
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
Person

477
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:28,064
And it's a distinction she says it just got lost that day

478
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,624
The precedent that you yourself say

479
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,416
What extender Banning the book

480
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,720
Assuming a particular person pays for

481
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,048
I think the court is already held in

482
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,888
Boston and Kim McConnell vote Congress

483
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
Coming up

484
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,400
We go behind the scenes into the mines actually of the justices

485
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,472
As they deliberate backstage about what to do next

486
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
And things get kind of weird

487
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,744
In the Supreme Court today a debate about the movie

488
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Sort of

489
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,536
Producers of a

490
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,072
Withering 90-minute movie

491
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
Hillary Clinton

492
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,144
Argued that part of the

493
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,192
Mccain-feingold campaign-finance

494
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,472
Is unkind

495
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:54,848
Alright so after oral arguments wrapped up the justices retreated

496
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,896
To what is perhaps the most

497
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,664
Secretive

498
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
Place

499
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,712
In the known universe

500
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:03,296
In the most private and perhaps important place inside the

501
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,064
Supreme Court

502
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,856
For lease inside the court.

503
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
And only then

504
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,952
Meet together around a table in the Justice

505
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,976
Is conference room

506
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,768
They discuss the cases

507
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,048
Heard an oral argument

508
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,584
And begin the process

509
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
Of reaching a decision of the Court

510
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,704
This is a place where cameras will never go

511
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,496
No one can enter the room

512
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,568
Except for some reason C-SPAN

513
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,616
UC spans feature documentary

514
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,896
The Supreme Court

515
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:33,504
What's 1 * C-SPAN those bastards were able to get into this room and film

516
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,272
The table

517
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
In the chair

518
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:41,440
I'm actually quite jealous cuz they didn't let us do that they didn't let us see

519
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:45,024
Special room or speak to the justices so she's been yeah

520
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,328
They have some kind of deal with the devil anyhow

521
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,120
When is we don't know

522
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,448
What happened in that room on that day but

523
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,496
We can piece together a couple of things

524
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,568
Imagine the rest of me we know that they went in

525
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,872
Clarence Thomas put on some tunes

526
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,944
RBG was like wow that book thing I need a drink

527
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:07,552
Actually don't know that either those two things happen but it makes sense to me the Clarence Thomas

528
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,344
Would like to do bees

529
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,880
I just feels

530
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
Right

531
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:18,560
But what we do know is that the Justice sat down in the usual order they said

532
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,120
The conference table in the same places every day

533
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:24,448
Chief justice Roberts gets things going with some discussion

534
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
Discussion

535
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,752
Pornography case

536
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
Save this cases

537
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,056
About this

538
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,336
The arguments are

539
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
7 spelling

540
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,152
I think we should reverse

541
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,712
So there's some conversation and then

542
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,552
Because again this is standard the Chief Justice called for a vote

543
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,624
This is the part we care about he

544
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,720
Presumably as his colleagues okay who here thinks it's citizens united has a case

545
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,048
Now we know that the four liberal justices

546
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,584
Steven Spencer Briar Suter

547
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,376
We're like no

548
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
They do not have a case

549
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:59,776
All that citizens united is doing is making a campaign ad this is electioneering

550
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,592
They're pretending it's a dark but really it's not they should be right here

551
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,128
On the other side

552
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,920
We know that the for conservatives

553
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,968
Scalia thomas alito Roberts

554
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,296
We're like yeah they got a case

555
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,624
Citizens United First Amendment rights are being pinched

556
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,672
Until you had a split

557
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:22,304
Like you often do on the score for liberals or conservatives but there are nine justices so as always

558
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,096
All attention turned

559
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,448
To the man in the middle

560
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,288
30 years

561
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:35,360
Is often the Swing Vote making his opinion critica

562
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
He is considered

563
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:42,528
The courts pivotal Swing Vote has basically split down the middle for 4

564
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:48,160
One ring to rule them all

565
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,488
All right let's just talk about Justice Kennedy for second he has been

566
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,536
The Swing Vote on this court

567
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:59,424
So many times that is often called the most powerful person in America

568
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,216
Because very often his boat

569
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,752
Is the only one that matters

570
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:07,360
You could argue that this one dude as determine more about your life

571
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
As an American

572
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,432
Can almost any other single guy

573
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:13,760
But

574
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,784
From the outside

575
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,600
People who don't really know much about the court II

576
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,880
Me you

577
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,184
Not maybe not you but me

578
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:27,840
It can be really hard to predict what he is going to do on any given case which way is going to swing

579
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120
For example

580
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,704
Arabic voting rights case he sides with the conservative

581
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,104
The Marshall Plan was very good to the Morrill Act of Northwest Ordinance

582
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,176
It does

583
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,712
100%

584
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,504
Goes to the developer in

585
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,368
Now on gun rights the Heller case if you talk about

586
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,904
Aswan conservative

587
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:59,072
I view it as a general right to bear arms quite without reference to the militia either way but Environmental Protection

588
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,376
Is liberal greater than harm the greater the risk

589
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,216
Class action goes conservative

590
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,008
What is the unlawful

591
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:10,592
Gay marriage is liberal

592
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,128
Exercise the fundamental right

593
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
Sumerian Allstate

594
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,712
No longer may this Liberty be denied to them

595
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,112
I want to be

596
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
So

597
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:28,768
When the Chief Justice went around the room and got to Kennedy was like alright Kennedy what's a Gummy this time

598
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,304
From the outside

599
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,584
It was anyone's guess

600
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,936
But as I mentioned one of the Serta cool things about the citizens united

601
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,704
Case

602
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,288
Is it gives you a little window into the mind of this

603
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,104
Very powerful very mysterious man

604
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,384
So before you answers

605
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:52,576
I was wanting

606
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,648
Romania Bucharest Romania

607
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,184
In the days of communism

608
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:04,096
You may wonder why is there an Eastern European man in the brain of Justice Anthony Kennedy that'll make sense to men

609
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,472
For now all you know is that this is Alex Kozinski he's an influential judge

610
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,800
Is it in the 9th circuit in California

611
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:18,176
It was actually a party member it was a member of the party before the war

612
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:23,040
Truly believe in communism if I was a great system and

613
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,112
How to remember the moment

614
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:32,768
When he was at his dad's office because I was about 7 years old or 7 or 8 or something and my father wasn't there

615
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:39,168
But a couple of other companies officials were and as her standing there Alex picks up a newspaper starts reading it was a newspaper

616
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,704
Called free Romania

617
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,240
And so I

618
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,776
Read free Romania

619
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:50,176
And then I ain't so sure I've sent to be funny I guess I said well I don't know why they called kilmainham because there's so many people in prison

620
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:55,040
You just thought he was making a joke my father into very serious trouble

621
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,856
The officials essentially threatened his dad

622
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:01,184
Because of this job question was whether the they were teaching me

623
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,976
Disloyal things at home

624
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,560
Eventually they clear them but it was it was touch-and-go

625
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:12,192
So after that my father had this signal he says if you're ever in public with me and

626
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,240
You say something and you hear me

627
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,544
Pinching my nose and sniffing

628
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,128
You just stop talking whatever it is you're saying you

629
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,688
Are you going to give an explanation you don't continue just

630
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
Stop docker

631
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,296
Years later

632
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:32,416
Alex Kozinski would leave Romania leave communism behind come to California

633
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
Become a lawyer

634
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:38,816
Then a clerk clerk in Sacramento for Anthony Kennedy

635
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,120
Who was the new judge on the ninth circuit

636
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,192
He says he told Anthony Kennedy the story oh yes

637
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:50,592
And they talked a lot about what it's like to live in a place where you can't speak your mind of course I know who knows

638
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:54,432
What exact effect has had on Anthony Kennedy's mine but we know

639
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,992
That story is in there my honor

640
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,272
I will do my best

641
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:01,600
Mixed in with all the cub scout oath service reviews

642
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,672
Sights and smells of Sacramento California where I grew up

643
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,816
Of course mixed in with all the Catholic church services

644
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:15,168
Stuff from me know summer spent in Austria teaching

645
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:19,264
So we know that story was in there was a we also know

646
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,592
Did a certain point growing up Anthony Kennedy read a book

647
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,408
The really large this hat 1984

648
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,944
One of those important

649
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,296
Works ever written 1984 of course of dystopian novel

650
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
By George Orwell

651
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:36,928
Kennedy talks about it all the time and speeches 1984

652
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,256
The dictatorship is always surveilling you

653
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,304
Trying to control your thoughts

654
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,608
You are so friendly

655
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,936
A1984 has one of the most brilliant themes in literature

656
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,824
The protagonist is being tortured

657
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,360
Chewing the writing you know.

658
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:59,200
Freedom is the freedom to say two plus two equals four

659
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:09,184
I probably can't stand the pressure anymore

660
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:14,304
Okay to intuos5

661
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,704
But the torture continues is it why you continually

662
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,240
The torture continued

663
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,544
Not until you just say it but until you believe it

664
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
Wichita

665
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,944
Already

666
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,832
This is

667
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
Powerful reminder

668
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,976
The government want to plan your destiny they want to plan what you think

669
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,536
Never happen

670
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,328
So clearly

671
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
Inside

672
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,680
Anthony Kennedy's mind

673
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:56,288
Maybe this is as close to an ideology as he has he's often talked about as having

674
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,152
Very little discernible ideology will maybe this is it inside his mind

675
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,688
There is a fear

676
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,968
A timer

677
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,248
Beer

678
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:11,648
Of the government getting too close of it reaching its authoritarian tentacles into our

679
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
Alives

680
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
Carmine's

681
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,232
In our bodies

682
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,304
Framers

683
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,584
An idea which is

684
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
Central

685
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,144
To Western thought

686
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,984
This is how we put it at his Supreme Court confirmation Hearing in 1987

687
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,008
And that is

688
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
There

689
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
Is a zone of Liberty

690
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,384
Arizona protection

691
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,944
A line that is drawn

692
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,040
Where the individual can tell the government be on this line you may not go

693
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:41,856
Incel

694
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,744
To go back to the secret room

695
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,120
When chief justice Roberts asked Justice Kennedy

696
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,168
Alright Kennedy which way you going to swing

697
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,216
I imagine what he said

698
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,776
Accessing the word imagine is alright Mister chief

699
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,336
I know you think I'm a swinger

700
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,640
I know everybody else thinks I'm a swinger

701
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,920
But on this issue

702
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:10,528
I do not swing not only do I think the citizens united has a case

703
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:14,112
But I think that campaign Finance law that would limit their speech

704
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:20,768
Shut down government

705
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,144
Who did parkour and said that it was lawful to ban of book

706
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:39,968
We know that two things happened after Kennedy so they gave his answer to Let's Go Big Lots tear it down

707
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,528
We know that the conservatives on the court were like

708
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,160
I like where you're going with this and they started to gravitate to his side we also know the David souter

709
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,952
He was the justice

710
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,280
In court she lie about anything she's deceit

711
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,816
She's ruthless cunning

712
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,632
Sounds to me like campaign

713
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,192
Who is basically accusing citizens united

714
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:03,008
Trying to pretend they were playing politics really they were

715
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,056
We know that Justice souter

716
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,080
Got really pissed

717
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:10,944
Because if we go into David suitors mind his room within a room

718
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,504
The view is very different

719
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,088
David souter is a New Englander

720
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
Quiet

721
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,136
Focus

722
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,952
Spend long afternoons reading

723
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:25,024
Walking through the silent Hemlock Forest

724
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:31,680
This is story that suitors home in New Hampshire was stacked with so many books that his house actually needed a new Foundation

725
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,984
Which is to say his reaction here was

726
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,008
Very out of character

727
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,056
By all accounts he was not

728
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:42,688
Happy because Kennedy's whole thing that Liberty is the law nothing should compromise that that for Suitor

729
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,736
Set up alarm Bells because

730
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,296
My exercise My Liberty to the

731
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,088
Greatest possible extent

732
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,112
I can suppress

733
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,648
The rights of a lot of people

734
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:57,280
That is souter a giving you talk in 2012 and what he means is that Liberty and equality

735
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:01,120
Have to be valid they both can't win all the way all

736
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,448
Corporate money just started pouring into elections

737
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,496
That's basically handing a mega

738
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,056
To the richest people in society

739
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,592
Does got2b

740
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,872
The possibility of

741
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,896
A limitation

742
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:13,920
Incorporation

743
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,968
So that they do not drown out

744
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:23,904
No we don't really know what David souter was thinking in this moment but I imagine I'm thinking forward

745
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:31,840
To everything that was about to happen explosion and political campaign donations

746
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:38,240
These two brothers are trying to buy America

747
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:44,640
Donald Trump essentially super Pacs are allowed to give unlimited fun

748
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:51,040
Billionaire hedge-fund Tycoon gets credited by many was playing an instrumental role in Donald Trump select

749
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:54,624
Action

750
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,512
Whatever he was actually thinking that moment

751
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
We know that

752
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,840
After Kennedy made his stance at let's go big

753
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,400
Justice souter justice souter

754
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,936
Wrote a very very

755
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,216
Strong draft

756
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,008
Descent a real Bridge burning

757
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:16,128
It's explosive I should coil Jeff toobin Jeffrey Rosen of the national Constitution say

758
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:20,224
He said that Kennedy's opinion is really an illegitimate use of the Court

759
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,272
Power the way the court was

760
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,296
Proceeding

761
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,112
Rick Braun suder accuses the court

762
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,928
Of the judicial activism

763
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,208
I'm taking

764
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,488
A narrow case

765
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,096
Pineal case but one teeny little film and then using it illegitimate

766
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,120
Lee as a hobby

767
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,936
To really rewrite the laws

768
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
Campaign Finance

769
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
He argued that this kind of move

770
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,312
Essentially makes

771
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,360
Them the court look like a bunch

772
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,896
Political hacks

773
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,456
Questioning the Integrity of the cord itself

774
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:57,600
Unfortunately we can't read that dissent that Sooner Road because his papers won't be public

775
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,648
Until 50 years after his death

776
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:03,488
All we know is that he most certainly sent a draft around to the other eight just

777
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,512
And then whatever

778
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,536
Didn't hold

779
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,840
Justice souter went to

780
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
That Bass

781
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,192
Keno

782
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,216
If we do this

783
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,496
Now

784
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,824
We will look bad your court

785
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,872
The Roberts Court

786
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,408
Real look bad

787
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,688
Someone described

788
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,968
His argument as

789
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,552
There are few institutional hot-button

790
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,344
That you press

791
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,624
In the courts.

792
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,416
And thanks

793
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,440
And justice

794
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,488
Suter was pressing one of those

795
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,768
Hot buttons

796
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,120
Apparently sing to a chief justice that your court is going to look bad is like

797
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,680
The Supreme Court equivalent of going nuclear

798
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:48,800
In the meantime we'll all this is happening you've got the 3 B's Bose bossy Bop

799
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:53,407
Baba baba baba baba

800
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:59,551
Does dying for an outcome in apparently every day we would go down to the court to see if they were going to

801
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,599
Issue decision in our case that

802
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,647
And of course each day

803
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,671
No decision

804
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,207
No decision

805
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,487
No decision

806
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,767
Yeah and it's now the end

807
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,071
Did June now we're down to the last

808
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,351
Day of the Court

809
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,399
10 a.m. June 29th

810
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,679
We're back in the car

811
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,471
Before

812
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,239
The justice

813
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,263
This is come on then

814
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,311
The clerk of the court

815
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:24,127
Walked into the courtroom and

816
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,663
Harrelson

817
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,223
He is if you were call the lawyer for the bees

818
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,503
And says I'm going to have to

819
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,551
Talk to you something

820
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,111
Later something unusual is going to happen

821
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:38,207
And pitocin that he told me later his first thought was uh oh

822
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,255
Did I do something wrong

823
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,583
The Marshall calls order

824
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,887
Honorable the Chief Justice

825
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,423
And the associate justices

826
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,471
Supreme Court of the United States

827
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,519
Oh yeah

828
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,823
Oyez oyez

829
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,895
The chief opens the session

830
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,735
And then in 1964 Congress enact

831
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,039
Kennedy recent opinion

832
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,319
In a different

833
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,879
And then RBG reads a dissent

834
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:10,207
But they had no vested right to promotion in a different

835
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,535
Get up there

836
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,327
What is fight does not

837
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:18,143
With an opinion in a different case

838
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,679
This is a strange resolved

839
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,959
But finally

840
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,239
Chief justice Roberts

841
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,263
Comes back in

842
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,543
And so the very last

843
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,311
Fasting

844
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,079
The teacher

845
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,359
Says before he

846
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
No ends

847
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,151
Term

848
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:33,247
Case number 08205 Citizens United versus the

849
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,015
The federal election

850
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,575
Is there will be reargument

851
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,343
Citizens united

852
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,647
Is set for reargument later this term

853
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,671
Bum

854
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,975
Chief justice Roberts Paisley says

855
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,023
We're not going to make up our mind today

856
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,071
The comeback

857
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,863
And talk about this again

858
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,935
And we're going to debated on Kennedy's term

859
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,007
Campaign Finance law mccain-feingold

860
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,311
Infringement of free speech

861
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,871
He says that

862
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,663
This is what happens next

863
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,199
Now we know it was sad

864
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,271
But this is the last session in which our friend and colleague

865
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,807
Justice David souter

866
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,343
Will be on the bench with us

867
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,367
Suitor

868
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,391
Is out

869
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,207
We wish him the best in his well-deserved retirement

870
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,535
On this occasion we have sent Justice souter a letter

871
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,815
That I will not read

872
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,631
Made it today

873
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,655
Dear David

874
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:29,311
We have all felt a profound sense of loss since the announcement of your decision to retire eventually he quote

875
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,895
What's the New England poet Robert Frost

876
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,199
Trade White marble for White Mountains

877
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,759
And return to your land

878
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,551
Easy wind and Downy

879
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,111
Oh you will not be among us

880
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,671
After he finishes

881
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:49,023
Justice souter Stern

882
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:53,887
Dear colleagues

883
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,031
You a generous letter is touched me more than I can

884
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:04,895
Say and I will only try to leave you with some sense of what are common Services meant tonight

885
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,431
He also quotes Robert Frost

886
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,711
You quoted poet

887
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,503
And I will too in words

888
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,063
Set out the ideal of the life engaged

889
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,599
We love

890
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,879
I need a one

891
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:22,815
Enterprise accounts for the finest moments of my life on this court as we have agreed or contended with each other over the

892
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,095
Those things that matter

893
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,631
Decent people in a civil suit

894
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,399
Society

895
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,495
419 fareham drive without life with you

896
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:34,079
All of us sharing our own desk to use with one another

897
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,895
Working side-by-side as fellow servants

898
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:37,919
Just friends

899
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:44,063
I will not sit with you at our bench again after the court Rises to the some of this time

900
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,903
But neither will I retire from our friendship

901
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,695
Which is held us together despite the

902
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,487
Full of the most passionate to send

903
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:55,583
Is made the work light us through all my tenure here

904
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,887
And for as long as I live

905
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,423
I will be thankful for it

906
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,263
And be under a very grateful obligation to each one of you

907
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:27,583
Alright let's be real I mean we cannot say for certain why Justice souter retired at that moment

908
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,607
Just a cigarette

909
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,655
For a long time that he didn't like

910
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,191
DC that he wanted to have

911
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:38,591
Time to hike while he was still vigorous enough to do it we also will probably never know exactly why Roberts

912
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,151
Held the case over for reargument what we do know

913
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,735
Is in holding the case over that meant suitors in

914
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,039
Flammatory Bridge burning descent

915
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,319
Would never be popped

916
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,367
The Roberts Court

917
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,647
Got to save face

918
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,183
And not have

919
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,463
This kind of in

920
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,231
Internal fight

921
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,279
Dirty laundry

922
00:46:59,327 --> 00:46:59,839
Avoided the

923
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,607
Embarrassment

924
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,375
Would have come from

925
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,399
Application of this

926
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,983
Play fast forward a couple months

927
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,823
The court reconvenes one more time to hear the case the room is packed

928
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:16,223
Standing room only three arguments 08 2:05 Citizens United vs

929
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,759
Federal election committee

930
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:18,783
Commission

931
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,319
And here's the thing

932
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,623
Everybody knew what was going to happen

933
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,975
Against

934
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:31,583
And there's no flight plan on going to go with more dangerous than in the elections

935
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
The government

936
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,631
Silence

937
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
Corporate objectives

938
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:41,823
And those corporations may have the most knowledge

939
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,639
Issues and in your stomach during the election

940
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,687
He'll probably come as no surprise that

941
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:52,063
Kennedy is it a whole lot of talking all that carrying on and when the court finally decided the case

942
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,599
Landmark decision five

943
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
The four

944
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:59,999
K08 205 Citizens United vs the FEC

945
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,583
Is the first amendment has any for

946
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:08,959
It prohibits Congress from finding or jailing citizens or associations

947
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,263
Simply engaged

948
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:16,383
Political speech is indispensable to decision-making in a democracy

949
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,711
Because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an individual

950
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,015
The government seeks to use its full power

951
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,807
Including equipment

952
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,647
The command where a person to get his or her information

953
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:31,231
Or what disgusting stores here she may not here

954
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,839
This is unlawful

955
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,847
No obviously

956
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:53,247
La people are not happy about this decision the American people

957
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:59,647
Save the world sneaking and cameras and of the Court you had President Obama at the State of the Union

958
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
Free of law

959
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,463
But I believe will open the floodgates

960
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,743
Professional

961
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,791
Including foreign corporation

962
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:11,167
Basically calling out the justices who were right there in the audience

963
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,471
And they're sitting right in front of from there

964
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:18,079
At one point the camera Zooms in on Justice Alito

965
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,103
At least friends

966
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,991
Samuel Alito grimacing and mouthing the words

967
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,271
Not true

968
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,087
Speaking of true here's what's true

969
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,463
The upshot of this decision I think most people would agree is a Suitor was right Obama was right

970
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,511
70-year ton more money in politics

971
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,047
Citizens united has made it

972
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,583
Hospital

973
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:44,191
The exact amount of new money that flooded in is a little bit hard to measure

974
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,495
But what's pretty clear is that all those super back

975
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:50,847
Superpass that you hear about

976
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
Foxboro Mass

977
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:58,015
He does things where I like an individual can give an unlimited amount of money to get someone elected or not

978
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,807
Rogue billionaires

979
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:06,207
Putting money into secret group 6 of the citizens united decision basically threw gasoline on that fire

980
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,023
But before we get ahead of ourselves

981
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,071
Everybody hates this

982
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:15,679
Not everybody hate people who object to it I'm going off the deep end

983
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,471
I think I've lost my mind

984
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,263
I think they're not truly liberals

985
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:25,663
This is 9th Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski again he was the guy in Kennedy's head the case stands for the symbol

986
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,687
Position graph

987
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,503
When you band together with other people

988
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,551
You don't lose your freedom of speech

989
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,343
What other bi Union or

990
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,367
Association

991
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,671
Corporation you know a lot of

992
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,207
A lot of organizations to

993
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:42,303
Take the corporate form this is Michael Dorn

994
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:46,399
He's a professor of law at Cornell a former Kennedy Clerk

995
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:50,495
Even though he is critical of the decision he says you do need to keep in mind

996
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,031
Any opinion itself

997
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,103
Essex County points out that under the law as it was written

998
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:58,687
The ACLU would be forbidden from putting on its website

999
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,967
An essay

1000
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,247
Promoting

1001
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,551
The candidacy of a Pro free

1002
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,575
Which candidate

1003
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,623
The n-double-acp

1004
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,927
He couldn't promote a pro civil rights case

1005
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,999
Twitchy might argue with those groups are not

1006
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:17,119
For-profit there should be a difference between not-for-profit and for-profit Slot The Washington Post

1007
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,399
Is this a for-profit

1008
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,447
CNN for profit

1009
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,471
These are

1010
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,495
Core

1011
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,263
Tatoosh ins

1012
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,031
Of our

1013
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,591
Christy they're protected by freedom of speech by freedom of the press

1014
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,407
So you say well okay so we're going to make it

1015
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,175
Exception

1016
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,199
4

1017
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,223
Media corporate

1018
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,759
What's a media corporate

1019
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,319
Media corporations are often just

1020
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:39,391
Divisions of other gigantic Corporation

1021
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,439
For a while

1022
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,231
Inbc was a

1023
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,767
Division of General Electric

1024
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,071
Does that mean that you're going to

1025
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,095
Carve up

1026
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,887
Which parts of their funds can go to the

1027
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,423
Speech rather than to other parts

1028
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,983
And do we really want to trust the government

1029
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,263
To draw the line

1030
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,079
Another it stings can get really complicated fast

1031
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,615
Which is why Alex Kozinski

1032
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,663
Funeral speeches funeral speech

1033
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,967
Let's don't touch it keeps government away from it

1034
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:08,319
And he says when the citizens united decision came out in perfectly right to me

1035
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,623
Still seems absolutely correct

1036
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,951
And I think I everybody who are all the people who object to it then

1037
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,719
Being foolish

1038
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:18,303
Now Justice Kennedy for his part 2 years ago

1039
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:20,351
He was at Harvard Law School

1040
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,119
School

1041
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:25,215
And having what they call these public conversations with

1042
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:25,983
The dean

1043
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,799
What is students

1044
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,359
I got up and asked him

1045
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,639
Do you regret your

1046
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,663
Vision

1047
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,431
5 years later

1048
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:39,807
Curious if you can stand by some of the assumptions that underlie your opinion there when you see all the money that has

1049
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,575
Chord

1050
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,111
To our elections

1051
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,415
And he said

1052
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,439
No

1053
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,463
I don't regret

1054
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,231
The decision

1055
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,279
Certainly in my own View

1056
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,583
What happens with money in

1057
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,351
And in politics

1058
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,631
That's not good

1059
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,423
But it does

1060
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,191
Sing to me

1061
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,215
One thing has been

1062
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:01,311
Disclosure people don't really have to worry because we have

1063
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,591
Disclosure laws

1064
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,871
And when these

1065
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:06,431
Corporate contributions are being made

1066
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,223
They have to reveal

1067
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,503
Who they are

1068
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,295
The funding source

1069
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:17,439
This is something he actually talked about explicitly in his citizens united decision

1070
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,463
Extensive

1071
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,231
Disclosure

1072
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,047
He told the students that transparency will protect you

1073
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,327
It'll protect us

1074
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,631
Did you live in this cyber age

1075
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:29,215
You don't need to wait for 3 months after the election for a reporter

1076
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,519
You can be done in 24 hours

1077
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,567
The voters don't like the people are funny

1078
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,103
Don't vote for

1079
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:38,431
His point is it if you have the information you need to make a good decision

1080
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,991
Nobody's Free Speech should be limited at all

1081
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,015
And this is

1082
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,295
Frankly

1083
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:46,623
Perfect example of the kind of high-minded principal

1084
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:47,647
That works

1085
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,183
In reality

1086
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,463
Not at all

1087
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:55,839
No

1088
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,631
I mean he's right

1089
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:01,215
There are disclosure laws but they are really

1090
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,495
Really easy to get around

1091
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,311
For example right now I could write

1092
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:09,663
3 million-dollar check to a 501 C 4 like

1093
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,943
Citizens united

1094
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,783
Or the NAACP for that matter and they would never have to tell anyone

1095
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,367
That money came for me

1096
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,159
I could just hide in the shadows

1097
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:24,255
That's why this kind of donations are often called

1098
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:27,071
Now there are people who could change this who can make

1099
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,655
Disclosure and actual meaningful

1100
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,423
Think

1101
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,447
For example

1102
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:40,639
The FEC is one of those places

1103
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,711
V FEC

1104
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,479
Could

1105
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,527
Choose to fix all the loopholes

1106
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:50,111
Require that all the money that's coming to politics in the wake of citizens united

1107
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,671
The very least be identified

1108
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,791
Is it the FEC is required by law

1109
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:01,631
To have no more than three Commissioners be a member of

1110
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,399
Party

1111
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,727
Essentially want there to be balance between Democrats

1112
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,799
And in this day and age what that means

1113
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,567
Is gridlock

1114
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:14,431
So with the idea of strengthening disclosure laws comes up

1115
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,455
Stalled comes up

1116
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,735
Install comes up

1117
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,783
Installed comes up get stalled

1118
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,063
Go years ago

1119
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,111
Here's a little fun going to tape

1120
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:26,719
Couple years ago two of the democratic members on the commission Gus

1121
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,999
So frustrated

1122
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,047
At the non action of this Commission

1123
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:32,095
That they petitioned their own commission

1124
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,143
To allow for public debate

1125
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,167
About things like

1126
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:40,287
Strengthening disclosure this is a recording of the open meeting of the Federal Election Commission held on June 18th

1127
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:43,103
2015

1128
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:48,479
Today this is commissioner and Ravel to allow people to comment

1129
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,271
Directly to the commission

1130
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,087
About issues that are of great importance

1131
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,111
To everyone

1132
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,135
In this country

1133
00:55:55,903 --> 00:56:02,047
Unravel is a Democrat she and her colleague Ellen Weintraub

1134
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:05,375

00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:11,007
One of the Republican members of the commission and got by the name of Matthew Peterson

1137
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:11,775
Sad

1138
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:17,407
Okay so you want to bring a petition but you don't look I'm looking in the rules here that says that only

1139
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,431
Quote person

1140
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,967
Can bring a petition

1141
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:22,015
Definition of person

1142
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,575
Excludes Taurus that does not include

1143
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:27,647
The federal government or any authority of the federal government

1144
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:33,023
That would seem to indicate that a commissioner acting in his or her official capacity

1145
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,559
Does not qualify as

1146
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,583
Is a person under a p

1147
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,351

How not to leave

1150
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,519
I thought you were actually going to take the position that I am not a person

1151
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:49,919
I just said that a corporation is a person but I'm not a person

1152
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:50,687
Around 11

1153
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,711
CFR and I will

1154
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,759
Stipulate that we're not in the room,

1155
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,671
I'm sorry that I'm not a person

1156
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:03,743
Another Deputy Commissioner Caroline Hunter falcon

1157
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:10,399
Bathtub that has gotten my colleagues will not admit that I'm a person that

1158
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:15,007
Really sweating because I'm a member of this commission I am not a person

1159
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:21,407
Is just kind of dumping I didn't mean literally you're not a person course your first

1160
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:24,223
Sing I think you're not an alien at least not today but

1161
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:25,759
But

1162
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:30,111
I asked the vice-chairman yesterday I said are you guys going to have a problem with this

1163
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:34,719
Is it good I just finished my I didn't say that I was just going like this

1164
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:38,047
If you don't put my head down I'll call on you now

1165
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:41,119
Thank you I really do find it comical that you're going to

1166
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,935
You are so opposed to having

1167
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:49,567
Dim the public has opportunity to weigh in on these issues that you're willing to take the legal position that we're not person

1168
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:52,127
I find it comical that

1169
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,407
We got an email.

1170
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,063
Getaway

1171
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,367
It's ironic

1172
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:08,767
Tyranny on the agenda thing but as I said I'm happy to consider the new proposals but I just don't like to do it on the net

1173
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,071
Like this

1174
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,655
This meeting is

1175
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423

Frustration

1179
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:30,271
And if the FEC is kind of useless when it comes to

1180
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,807
Fixing is home money in politics

1181
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:32,575
Sting

1182
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,159
And if the courts of seventh chords of sad will where do we look for help

1183
