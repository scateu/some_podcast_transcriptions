00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:05,888
WNYC Studios

2
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:12,800

Hey I'm genogram ride this is more perfect

5
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,648
A miniseries

6
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,440
We're just getting going up

7
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,744
Some of the ideas in the cases

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,512
Flow through

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,280
The Supreme Court

10
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,328
We're going to start the series off with a

11
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,680
With a story that isn't so much a courtroom drama this one is about an issue that

12
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,984
I think everybody agrees is about to land at

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,752
The Supreme Court

14
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,288
Again in a bit

15
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,104
Story comes from reporter Karen Duffin

16
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,640
And it begins with the Mist

17
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,992
Alright so we're starting with

18
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,320
My rights Maya Maya

19
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
I am the dark

20
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,392
How to tame a tree

21
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:06,048
Okay so my afoa lives in London and when she was about 25 she had

22
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:09,632
Graduated from college she was doing some theater things but she was

23
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
Like having this quarter life crisis and didn't know what to do with her life was called blue but I Central crisis

24
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:22,432
Organizations in Santa Ana please can I be useful to you

25
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:28,832
Plantation that did death penalty cases like a bunch of lawyers or what are they doing

26
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:33,952
They've been working on the death penalty for like years at that point to try to abolish it

27
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,512
I view the death penalty and I

28
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280
Beautiful

29
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,328
What time is it at the shop end

30
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
A series of

31
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,400
Societal injustices

32
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:47,264
So anyway she's at reprieve one night this is 2010 I was sat in the office and

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,128
She's sitting there one night and Clive Stafford Smith who's the president of reprieve or the head of reprieve

34
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,408
Calls and says

35
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,944
Execution tonight

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,552
The execution in Arizona tonight

37
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
For killing Chester dryer

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,904
Lander

39
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184
And stabbing the man

40
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,208
In 1989

41
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:12,608
There's an execution tonight and we just found out that the lethal injection drugs that they're going to use

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,632
It came from a

43
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,168
Pharmacy in England

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
But we don't know which pharmacy because Arizona refuses to release

45
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:24,640
Is the name does anyone in the office have some time alone to have some time to figure out whether stocks could have come

46
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,712
She raises her hand and she's like I have 30 minutes you know

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,528
I didn't know

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
What I was talking when I stopped

49
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
I want to find this

50
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
Supplier like why does it help them

51
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,952
What the drugs did they want to use an Arizona hat

52
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
To be updated

53
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:43,840
So they can find who made these drugs and prove that they are not FDA-approved and they can

54
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,864
Probably stop the X

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,936
Do they have any reason to think the drugs were it FDA approved

56
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,472
Is kind of a Hail Mary

57
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
Also

58
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,616
I started the half-hour research tasks that is taking me now five and a half years

59
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,664
I was trying to figure out with

60
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:02,784
Limited information where sodium thiopental could have come from in the UK to get

61
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,416
U.s. sodium thiopental is an anesthetic and for a long time it was one of the most common anesthetics used

62
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,512
In surgeries but it's also one of the drugs used in lethal injection

63
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,048
I was so

64
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
I didn't think I knew

65
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,192
The puppets full reset that I didn't but I was doing it very quickly

66
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,984
Because of course they have

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
Houston at night

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,056
Is running out of time

69
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
And option

70
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:31,456
I was in the UK so it's the evening morning Arizona time.

71
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,992
Number of algal species

72
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,784
Frantically searching

73
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,576
Medical regulations

74
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:41,696
And you know she can't figure out exactly what the name of the company is there's no way to know at that point

75
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,024
But ultimately she does figure out that there are no

76
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
UK companies

77
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,864
Authorized to ship this drug to the US

78
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,888
That was no

79
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,960
Effectively no FDA approved supplier of the star

80
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:57,568
Suit whatever this mystery Pharmacy was it probably wasn't FDA-approved

81
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,592
And I remember

82
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,200
And I emailed that over I think we had the time to intern affidavit from meal from fly

83
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,296
They write up a quick affidavit they send it back to the states and

84
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,600
The execution that night was

85
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
Stayed

86
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
Like halted

87
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,952
When I went to sleep and having stayed and I just thought I'd

88
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
You got a bit of time

89
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,791
Next morning

90
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,327
Workout

91
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
Did someone say

92
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,399
And I turned on World Service Center

93
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,495
Burnouts that Jeffrey landrigan

94
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
Was executed at 22

95
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,591
26 hours

96
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
Yeah

97
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,687
His final meal

98
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
Was

99
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
A piece of steak

100
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
His last words were

101
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Well

102
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,391
I'd like to say thank you to my family

103
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,439
And Boomer Sooner

104
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
It turned out well Maya was asleep

105
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
The state of

106
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
All the way to

107
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
Supreme Court

108
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,423
The justices by 524 votes lifted

109
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
The stay of execution

110
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
Allowing landrigan

111
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,775
I could be put to death last night

112
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:06,175
Was put in place due to concerns over lethal injection drugs one of those drugs obtained from Britain

113
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,503
Was not FDA-approved but the US Supreme Court did rule

114
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,783
That there was no reason

115
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,391
Not talk about a rude awakening

116
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
Electro sac

117
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,095
Is that rude awakening with

118
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:29,983
Send my on a journey around the world it would get her called out by the United States Supreme Court it would Spark

119
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,055
A global conversation about the American death

120
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,895
Modell's little words cruel and unusual

121
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
Are embedded in our Eighth Amendment

122
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,855
United States

123
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,655
Supreme Court of the United States

124
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,775
United States

125
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
Dairy bacteria

126
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:25,535
So we were in London with Maya who just learned that Jeffrey landrigan had been executed but to understand which she

127
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,583
Does next let me just give you a little bit of

128
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:36,031
In the fall of 2010 when Jeffrey landrigan was executed

129
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
The drugs that they use

130
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:43,967
The lethal drug sodium thiopental is suddenly in really short supply

131
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,319
Is the only us company that still made that drug with housing

132
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,391
Leica manufacturing problem so they have stopped manufacturing

133
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:57,791
Producing the strad so you actually see these emails between states like do do you have any sodium thiopental

134
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
California got help

135
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
From right next door

136
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:04,703
Arizona agreed to lend California a cup of death

137
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:11,103
And there's actually someone great email exchange between like the California Department of Corrections they send eras

138
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,919
Thank you email and I quote

139
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:18,271
You guys in Arizona are Lifesavers

140
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,087
Will buy you a beer next time I see you

141
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,647
You're a Life Saver Come on

142
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,927
So

143
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,975
When Jeffrey landrigan is said to be

144
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,767
Executed Arizona is out of that

145
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,815
And this is how they end up at

146
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,607
This mystery Drug Company in London

147
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:41,567
So after the execution my is doing all this research she's calling Pharma company on to these documents and

148
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:47,967
Very quickly she learns that the same company that is sending drugs to Arizona at 10 drugs till I can buy lots of different states

149
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,807
South Carolina Kentucky and dryers at the places

150
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,415
They actually become one of the primary suppliers that we've won Jackson Drugs to the United States

151
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,743
Why was it so hard to find out information about this company

152
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,607
So what happens is that anybody involved with an execution your name is kept confidential

153
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,399
And states have started keeping

154
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,191
Companies names confidential to

155
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
IC

156
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:13,823
So the next few starts calling suppliers and Distributors kind of trying to trace

157
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,663
Like how did this drug get to that company thinking that maybe that'll lead her to it

158
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,943
We had figured out

159
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
It had

160
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,759
Come originally

161
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
From

162
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
I was active ingredients made in

163
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,623
Some of those with

164
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,159
Sent over to Germany

165
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:34,559
The package put into files those were sent over to the UK that was one company that had got the Moxie with vibration

166
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,887
Sold their soul to another one that company chasing men

167
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
They were sent to

168
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,471
Best company in England

169
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,775
What she still can't figure out the identity of

170
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,335
But then the real breakthrough came just

171
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,383
Couple months after Jeffrey landrigan was

172
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:55,295
I think it was a lot of material coming out of that time I'm going to California and the ACLU got a bunch of documents and in one

173
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
One of these batches of documents

174
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
She finds an invoice

175
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
And this invoice

176
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,439
I just

177
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,511
I just remember getting the court documents and I was

178
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,559
I was walking with the Spotify slow internet connect

179
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,119
She was actually in Malawi at the time just

180
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
Constantly

181
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,751
Are willing the computers down at the document so I could stop even looking

182
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
In treatment figuring out

183
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,591

This Pharmacy

201
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,407
Except that it doesn't look like a pharmacy

202
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,479
Because it's got a big sign on the front that says

203

Tiny little storefront

00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,239
Don't see any evidences

212
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,823

228
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519

246
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
Alright let it be

247
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
Fatigue

We surprised when they

255
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
Fry's

256
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,503
I guess it unravels

257
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
Very much

258
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Felicia

So what do you want

261
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
So now

262
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
Irrelevant

263
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
Amscot interest

264
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,639
You're not in the business of

265
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
Irrelevant

266
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
Well thank you very much

267
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
Glacier

00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
You know my name

269
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
If not find

270
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
Coalition

271
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:02,591
The once Maya and reprieve found that guy mehdi alavi and his pharmaceutical broom closet of death The Next Step

272
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:07,455
Was pretty simple went to the UK government and they told them because in the UK it's

273
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,271
Illegal to be part of capital punishment in any way

274
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,087
We have a little bit that Sports

275
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
A product

276
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:21,023
For the facilitation of capital punishment

277
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,303
Patience with this text

278
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:28,191
Unique in the world continuous compound look a message to The Fight Against torture and the death penalty

279
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
When they realized

280
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,079
That the sole purpose of the exports of this drug

281
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
Waze

282
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Prosecution

283
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,919
Stay put an Xbox controller

284
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,759
And just like that the supply of this drug is turned off

285
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
To the states or just out of luck

286
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:48,159
Well I mean 60% of Americans support the death penalty so that they're not going to give this up

287
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
Without a fight

288
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,207
And so

289
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:57,631
Over the next few years you have like this arms race Missouri says we're going to find the drug in Germany so

290
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,935
My address to Germany

291
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:04,031
And then she hears that a company called hospira is about to make the drug

292
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
In

293
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,407
Italy

294
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,943
Italian government

295
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,783
Really didn't want drugs made in the seat of the Pope to be

296
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,319
Execution

297
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:22,719
Paris pics passing said we cannot take the risk that we will be held liable by the Italian authorities if it's

298
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,535
Contact is diverted for use in capital punishment

299
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,815
And then

300
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
Denmark

301
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:34,751
Bunch of stage of Florida Ohio Alabama 11 other states they all decide they're going to get their drug from this company called

302
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
My account

303
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,567
I remember my first Cool Whip

304
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,919
She's like I'm did you know that your drugs being used in executions and they were like what

305
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:48,319
It certainly came shoot surprise for US vice president for communications at

306
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
We have

307
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,951
In the farm industry for a little more than hundred years

308
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,999
And we are here to

309
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Safe

310
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
People's lives

311
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,839
This was the complete opposite

312
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
It Off

313
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
The intention of

314
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
Offer this product

315
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,471
Amaya says that she heard the same thing

316
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
All over the world

317
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,823
Even when States like Nebraska and South Dakota go to

318
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
India today

319
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
Get their drugs

320
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,919
And it's interesting in India because

321
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,199
India have capital punishment

322
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,247
So this isn't an objection

323
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Capital punishment

324
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
This is

325
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,855
From every company has spoken to in India

326
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
They say but

327
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647
Why

328
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,695
Why would they use medicine

329
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,511
Like if you're going to kill someone just kill them

330
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:35,167
Why are you using something that saves lives to do it

331
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:41,567
And actually there's a really interesting story about why we do it that way

332
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
That's coming up

333
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,455
I'm more perfect

334
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,855
Amgen aboumrad this is more perfect

335
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,183
A miniseries about some of the ideas and cases that

336
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,231
Flowing through the Supreme Court

337
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
Back to restore from reporter Karen.

338
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:05,119
So we left off with Maya in India and their wondering Baidu

339
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,423
Do you guys use drugs to kill people

340
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,959
Why would they use medicine

341
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
So what is the answer to life

342
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,591
Why do we dancers that goes back to this guy named Bill Wiseman

343
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,383
It's a terrible thing

344
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,175
To have one's

345
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:23,039
Reputation B&B based on on

346
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,319
Coming up with a new

347
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
Way to kill people

348
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,391
Bill Wiseman was a rising star

349
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
He loved

350
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:35,583
Wiseman died in a plane crash in 2007 this is him in an interview with reporter named Scott Thompson

351
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,655
Nkotb in Tulsa back in 2005

352
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
What is what

353
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
Spell story

354
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:47,103
So he grew up his dad's a minister is Grandpa's a minister and he's like I don't want the family business and he want

355
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:53,503
For years he he buy his account wanders through like 2 and 1/2 literature degrees he becomes a poet

356
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,903
He drinks a lot of corn liquor and you know he finally ends up in construction where he starts working with politicians and he's like oh

357
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:06,303
This is my calling I want to be a politician so he gets elected to the Oklahoma State Legislature in 19

358
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
74 +

359
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:11,679
Opposed to the death penalty and luckily for him this would just happen

360
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:18,591
Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional today

361
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:23,455
Miles across the country in 1972 the Supreme Court actually abolished the death penalty

362
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,271
Cuz they said it was being applied unfairly or

363
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
Haphazard

364
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,599
In a way that could only be called

365
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
Cricket

366
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,207
So Bill Wiseman is in the Oklahoma Legislature and he's like

367
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,767
Great this is not a problem we'll ever have to worry about

368
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,583
Thomas the public is furious about this decision

369
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,983
Support goes from 50 to 63% in just two years

370
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,543
Absolutely I

371
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,943
Very much in favor and favor of it we get some Law & Order into this country.

372
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,527
I don't think you should have taken away in the first place in almost immediately 35 States

373
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:02,623
Rewrite their death penalty laws essentially saying like no no we can do this right

374
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,415
And in 1976

375
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,439
Supreme Court says

376
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
All right

377
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,791
If you can administer the death penalty fairly and humanely

378
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
You can have it back

379
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:16,959
So 9072a death penalty abolished 1976 it's reinstated

380
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,775
Bill Wiseman get selected smack-dab in the middle of this

381
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,823
You know 1976

382
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Suddenly

383
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:27,711
There's a bill in Oklahoma State Legislature about whether to reinstate the death penalty and bilhah

384
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
The vote on that

385
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
I know

386
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
The capital punishment

387
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,111
Interested it doesn't work doesn't

388
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,183
And I couldn't see any way to justify

389
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,719
I also knew

390
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,791
Then if I'd voted against it from my district

391
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
I would

392
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,351
Run a high chance

393
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,375
Getting whooped

394
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,215
Cuz 80% of his constituents were in favor of the death penalty

395
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,519
After all that wondering

396
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,823
Honey, this job that you love

397
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,151
Having the best time and I didn't want to get whooped so I was

398
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
In a real dilemma

399
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
What you do

400
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
The wrong thing

401
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,831
Devoted to reinstate the death penalty

402
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
For whatever reason

403
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:12,767
Of ego or vanity or need or the motivation to get reelected whatever the reasons

404
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,559
I knowingly made it

405
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,095
A decision

406
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,887
When I know is wrong

407
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,639
Susan the legislature and he's feeling like he just sold his soul

408
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:35,039
And as they're debating various amendments to this law someone brings up something sort of vaguely about a more humane

409
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,111
Mean way to execute people and he's like that yes.

410
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:42,463
And he becomes obsessed with this idea I was like a way to assuage his guilt

411
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:48,863
Yeah so he brings up some anesthesiologist and doctors and says I want to find a better way to do this and they say we can't help you cuz

412
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
The credit goes to no harm.

413
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,775
Did a little bit of arms 3 goes to the State medical examiner a guy named Jay Chapman

414
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:00,639
And Jay just sort of like freestyles has one line that that bill

415
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:04,991
Literally just sits with a yellow legal pad and rights word for word

416
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,087
I'm an intravenous saline drip should be established

417
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,391
High-end which be introduced

418
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,415
Hey

419
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,463
Ultra short acting barbiturate

420
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,487
In combination

421
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
Michael paralytic

422
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:22,655
The idea is that these three drugs would allow them to execute people but but painlessly

423
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,239
And right there in that office with just like

424
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,519
Yellow legal pad

425
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,847
They invent lethal injection in America

426
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
It would be

427
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,247
Hard to overstate just how important this

428
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,551
Moment in this offices because

429
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,087
The supreme court of justice

430
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,159
Given the country back the death penalty on the

431
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,999
Ground and the idea that we could we could do this right

432
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,071
And what bill has just handed America

433
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:55,679
Is is it a way to have the death penalty but but had to be humane

434
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
The ideal death battle

435
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
Yeah

436
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,847
Oklahoma adopted and then the very next date

437
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,151
Texas does and then dozens of states and

438
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
Since that moment

439
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,735
88% of all executions

440
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
Injection

441
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,623
I don't hear the word lethal injection or execution or anything else without

442
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,928
Feeling a tug

443
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,208
It's it's tied to me

444
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
I mean I'll always be

445
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,144
Which he live to regret he thinks that he actually extended the life of the death penalty and he actually eventually quit

446
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,216
This job becomes a pastor and becomes a very

447
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,520
A strong anti-death penalty

448
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
Advocate

449
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,824
How does a man

450
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
Who came up with the recipe

451
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
For lethal injection

452
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,432
What does he do on judging

453
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,248
The same thing everyone else does

454
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,064
So ourselves on the mercy of God

455
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,856
Say that way

456
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,880
Have done wrong

457
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,816
Nothing that I find really interesting is that if you look at the Modern lethal injection cocktail

458
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
Three drugs

459
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,912
FasTrak special needs Society II drug paralyzes you

460
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,472
And the Third Reich is the answer that stops

461
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,496
Tartan Kilt

462
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:08,640
In this drug cocktail you kind of see everything that we want and need from the death penalty just kind of all mix

463
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
Together

464
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,784
The third drug the drug that stops your heart that's kind of our sense of justice

465
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,600
The first drug the anesthetic

466
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,416
Kind of our sense of humanity or kindness

467
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,208
That second drug

468
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,000
The one that paralyzes their muscle

469
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,280
Fold the second draw

470
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,816
Is purely cosmetic

471
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,352
It sucks

472
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,888
No medical purpose

473
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:35,008
The reason it was put into the lethal injection cocktail in the first place was

474
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,032
So that

475
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,104
FasTrak doesn't work effectively

476
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,712
The second drug will mask any signs of

477
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,576
Visible suffering and it would be extremely significant

478
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,368
Because potassium chloride

479
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,696
Potent acid that people have described as

480
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:58,304
Being like fire going through your veins and being burnt alive from the inside

481
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,888
She said just imagine that that's happening to you

482
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,960
But something goes wrong with the anesthetic and you become conscious

483
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
You have this

484
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,544
Burning acid going through your body

485
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,616
And you're paralyzed all your voluntary muscles

486
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
Paralyzed

487
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,176
So you can't say

488
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,760
I'm awake I can feel everything this is agony

489
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:23,904
She says that it's that second drug that is both the thing that could make the execution most torturous

490
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,464
And the thing that meant that

491
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,256
Tweed Witnesses the views

492
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
Public

493
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,816
Wouldn't know that it was torture

494
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,120
Because we weren't supposed to know that

495
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,192
2 does she end up going after that second drug

496
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:41,824
The paralytic no actually seek she goes after the first ride the anesthetic and it's a total coincidence this is just

497
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,896
The one that had manufacturing problems that started the arms race

498
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,200
But it turns out that

499
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,736
This drug

500
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
Sodium fire

501
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,552
The anesthetic is the one that's

502
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,856
The most constitutionally important drug

503
00:23:54,112 --> 00:24:00,256
Because in 2008 when the Supreme Court ruled on lethal injection they said

504
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:03,584
The first drug is necessary to prevent the prisoner

505
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,888
From experiencing severe pain

506
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,168
So there's no anesthetic

507
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,448
There's pain

508
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,568
Which would be too severe and then be there for what an Eighth Amendment violation

509
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,360
Cruel unusual punishment

510
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,688
So that drug the anesthetic is the key drug

511
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:24,832
But over the past five and a half years is Maya has like Wacom old her way across these different companies

512
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,392
She just made it harder and harder to get

513
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,952
There now 20 + companies

514
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:36,352
Who have they said we disapprove of the misuse of medicine executions than we going to take steps to prevent

515
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:42,240
And that has States scrambling the drugs used in a 32 death penalty States

516
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:48,640
Or now running out run out of drugs and is it resolved but you seems that things have gotten very DIY

517
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:53,248
Weather changing and trying new procedures never used before in the history of execution

518
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,064
Prison officials are in a difficult position

519
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:02,464
Human have the da start rating prison

520
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,864
Their Central using illegal drugs at this point until reporters are just starting to pay more attention and

521
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,008
In the middle of all that he began kicking his feet lifting his head in his chest off the gurney grimacing

522
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
How do you also get

523
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,312
Seems like this

524
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,640
High Country season in and a couple moments he actually mumbled

525
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:26,272
You would open his mouth and you'd see his chest move and we'll go all the way down to stomach so so clear gas

526
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:33,440
April 29th 2014 in Oklahoma a man in Clayton Lockett was being executed for murder rape and

527
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:39,840
Kidnapping Lockett execution used and new drug combination whose source is unknown he was sedated and declared unconstitutional

528
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,864
Conscious but

529
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,400
Started thrashing

530
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,960
Clenching his teeth and start moving the arm

531
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,776
43 minutes to die

532
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,848
Grizzly horrific spectacle

533
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:55,200
Happening after an hour and 57 minutes

534
00:25:55,456 --> 00:26:01,600
Your situations like this in Arizona Ohio this drug formula is unconstitutional because

535
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,184
Started filing a bunch of lawsuits and one of these eventually got to

536
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
Supreme Court

537
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,792
1470 955

538
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:14,656
An interesting lie when it got to the Supreme Court

539
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,448
Things got very thin

540
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,240
This is Justice Alito

541
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
Is saying essentially

542
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,848
Actually a problem you made it a problem

543
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,896
Executions to be carried out

544
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,944
Ashley there many jurisdictions

545
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,248
Their jurisdictions in this country their jurisdiction

546
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:36,160
Two different drugs

547
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,696
By the abolitionists

548
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:42,816
And this is Justice Scalia

549
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,376
States cannot obtain

550
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:51,008
And now you want to come before the court and say well visits third drug

551
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,800
It's not 100% sure

552
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,040
Is it appropriate for the Judiciary

553
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,088
To countenance what amounts

554
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,624
To a guerrilla War

555
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
Against

556
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
What you think it means by Guerilla War

557
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
I think he's

558
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:18,400
Trying to say there are ways to 2 if you want to make the death penalty illegal you have ways to do it

559
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,960
You can call your legislator you can pressure them big

560
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:24,800
That's a lot but you're trying to like hide in the trees and like pulled

561
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
Drugs off

562
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
And

563
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,616
Make themselves scarce

564
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,152
That you're forcing

565
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,944
Illegal problem that doesn't exist

566
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,832
It's about you answer to the question

567
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
You've been interrupted

568
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,696
Does justice has called you guys out kind of

569
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
It's

570
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,816
Look into this a lot of narrative around this being

571
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,096
Activate

572
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,912
But this is nothing to do

573
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,704
With me or anyone else

574
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,496
It's that the companies

575
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
Don't want that medicines uses

576
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,152
Options that manufactures the Distributors the pharmacist anesthesiologist

577
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:04,224
Whoever else it might be the Indian industry

578
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,040
None of them has to be positive

579
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,832
Ohio capital punishment machine

580
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,744
Is there an argument to be made here I mean I get what you're saying that like all these different people in different countries have been like unknowingly

581
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,280
Grafted onto Ohio sex

582
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:21,120
Execution team which doesn't seem fair but isn't there an argument to be made that like

583
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,656
Even so

584
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:26,240
The effect is that she has taken a death penalty that is

585
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,544
Kind of Humane Maybe

586
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824
And made it more cruel

587
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,384
Because that's kind of the accusation in the air

588
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
It's

589
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,992
I'm going to say two things one of them

590
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,784
She didn't cause it she's

591
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:45,184
The states are chasing the companies and she's chasing the states rights so like you can't say that she caused it but what you more important

592
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,512
But you also can't say is that it is actually more cruel

593
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,280
Because

594
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,816
There's no evidence

595
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,096
That there's been an in

596
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,120
Increase in Boston

597
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
Executions

598
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,704
What I think is happening is just that we're paying

599
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,496
More attention to lethal injection

600
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
Tonight we're just

601
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,032
Looking at it more

602
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,384
Bosch excuse has been happening forever and we're just now noticed

603
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
Yeah

604
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:09,248
None the less people do accuse her of making this more cruel and nausea

605
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,528
The drugs

606
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
Because

607
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:16,160
States in their sort of desperation to still be able to do this are looking for other ways

608
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
To do it

609
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,720
And some of those ways

610
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,024
Might seem like we're going

611
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,072
The lady that was

612
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:28,448
Spearheaded the getting rid of the injections all she did is basically force people to be shot

613
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,288
This Paul Wray state representative house district 13 Utah

614
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,360
He says one day he was sitting in his office

615
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:39,712
That was actually listening to the local NPR station in federal judge in Oklahoma

616
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,504
And they're talking about

617
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,296
European pharmaceutical companies

618
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,832
Used to provide this country

619
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,624
Bristol drug but now refuse to sell it to

620
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,976
European drug companies no longer selling the drug cocktail

621
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:56,096
So I called our department of corrections and says hey do we have access to the drug and they said no we don't

622
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,656
How you know we have a set amount and then we're out

623
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,448
Because he hung up the phone.

624
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,240
Thinking a little bit of research

625
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,288
Kind of deep into the history and

626
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:09,664
Eventually came to the conclusion well let's revert back the firing squad

627
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:15,040
Play me like firing squad John Wayne firing squad like line up against the wall

628
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:19,392
No it's like they have a chair and they bring the person into the room and they strap

629
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:25,792
Them to the chair they put a hood over their head position will look at the heart and I'll pin a Target where the heart is and then there's five men with r

630
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,864
Rifles and one of them has a blank but none of them know which one it is

631
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,192
And then on the 20 orders given they all shoot the individual

632
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:32,960
In the heart

633
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:39,616
Lawmakers in Utah voted to bring back executions by firing squad

634
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:46,016
What is Lethal Injections are not readily available already says he was just trying to solve a problem

635
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:52,416
Completely taken off guard by the media frenzy that

636
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:58,816
Have the cruel relic of Old West Justice Henry lenet International condemnation

637
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,888
Stopping it now is an embarrassment that barbaric

638
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,472
We should be shooting our people this is ridiculous this is not the time

639
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
Bob Moses

640
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,544
Why is it sad

641
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,848
Do you think the firing squad itself

642
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
Created this

643
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,944
Well it it's it's brutal

644
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,552
You know it's it's certainly not the easy give him a couple of injections in

645
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
They quietly

646
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,600
Go down

647
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,904
You know this is calling it for what it is

648
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
In fact

649
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,976
I would argue you want to look at

650
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,792
At something that's more Humane and you definitely the fiery sky

651
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:34,912
What caught my attention was it was so sudden so quick

652
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,960
Boom boom just like that

653
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:40,032
These are reporters talking about witnessing at firing squad X

654
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:40,800
Houston and Utah

655
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,080
It was over

656
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,408
Pretty quickly it was cleaner than I expected

657
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,944
And it was fast

658
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,736
With the firing squad

659
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,528
Yeah your ear dead Within

660
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,576
Your seconds of the pulling the trigger

661
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,624
Bible is directly to the heart

662
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
It's over

663
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,464
Not the paralytic that hides its is done

664
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,768
Buddy buddy moved

665
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,328
He moved a little bit

666
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,400
To some degree that bothers me

667
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,960
And that seemed to carry on

668
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,240
Alaska

669
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:11,776
60

670
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
222nd

671
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:24,064
This is how you tie his chosen to solve the Wacom old problem has already been upheld by the Supreme Court

672
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,344
Approved

673
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,136
Electrocution

674
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,952
We have approved death by firing squad

675
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:35,840
That's Justice Scalia in 2008 the Supreme Court actually approve the firing squad in 1879

676
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,704
And the people who are part of the firing squad are actually volunteers

677
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,104
Do you have a lack of volunteers or in abundance of volunteers

678
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,128
They had hundreds

679
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,176
I'm nobody's forced to do it is

680
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:53,760
Another there are people that are willing that big Tennessee is their civic duty

681
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,808
You know the help carry these out

682
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,624
I'm always down there I actually asked Paul

683
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
I really wanted

684
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:05,536
If you put me in touch with somebody who's actually been involved with the firing squad

685
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,584
I'll call somebody

686
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Okay

687
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,424
Better wait till this thing

688
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,288
16th and Hill Air Force Base

689
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,824
All right I like it the sound of

690
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,968
This is Kenny we agreed not to use his last name and Ken's Dad ran the firing squad for a couple of decades

691
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,064
So as you see there's two cottonwood trees over here those old cottonwood trees

692
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,088
They'd set up an

693
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,136
And that's what they would drill the firing squad

694
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,208
These men were selected because for one there

695
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,488
Absolute monarchs

696
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,560
Tuesday just had moral clarity

697
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,096
They

698
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:44,192
Many of them did not want to be on there but once they were called

699
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,728
They felt obligated

700
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
To see it through

701
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:51,616
And told me that on execution days his dad and the other Shooters they would sit down together at the

702
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,944
Kitchen table and you know it's just like a little family family breakfast

703
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,992
This mom should make coffee and

704
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:01,344
She would do scones or biscuits and gravy and she wanted those men to know

705
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,160
That it wasn't easy and that she appreciated

706
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:08,000
I know there was a lot of prayerful times around the house and nose

707
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,072
Mentor over getting ready and I know that

708
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
I am

709
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,192
It is pretty solemn moment I prayer

710
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,264
Is it for the person being executed the victim with

711
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
The prayer

712
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,848
I think you have to pray for strength to follow through on what you have

713
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,944
I think that

714
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:31,296
You know you might need a little guidance and you might need a little understanding and

715
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,600
And something bigger than yous out there

716
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
I think that

717
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:40,000
If we're going to have the death penalty people just have to understand that there's some savagery involved in it

718
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,792
And nah

719
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,608
It's unfortunate that it is but

720
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,400
If we have it to do list

721
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,192
Let's do it let's do it humanely

722
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,800
One of the things that I found kind of striking is that

723
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:57,408
My afoa is against the death penalty and you have to focus in Utah that are for it

724
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,968
But everyone seems to agree that

725
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,272
We shouldn't fool ourselves

726
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,064
I favor the death penalty

727
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,672
But one thing I've never favored in some common ground between me and the abolitionists

728
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,976
Is that lethal injection

729
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,512
Is a terrible method of

730
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
Execution

731
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,096
That's Robert blecker at a New York law school professors

732
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,144
Sounding a little bit like Maya

733
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,472
But he says he objects to lethal injection not because it's

734
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,520
Cruel not because it might cause

735
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288
Pain

736
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,592
But because it certainly causes confusion

737
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,872
I attended

738
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,920
An execution in Florida

739
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,456
Bennie Demps

740
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:36,576
And I also was with my father-in-law when he was in a hospice dying for

741
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,880
From an incurable and very painful cancer

742
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,928
And the death scene

743
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,696
In both

744
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,720
Situations

745
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,512
This was bizarrely similar

746
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,816
In both cases the

747
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,120
The person dying was

748
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,936
Lying on a gurney with an IV coming out of his arm

749
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,984
Wrapped in white sheets

750
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:58,080
Medical technicians at his side surrounded by loved ones

751
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,152
And it struck me as bizarre

752
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,480
That we are killing Those whom we love

753
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,528
In a fashion

754
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,320
That's so nearly resembles

755
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,880
How we are killing those we rightfully

756
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
Detest

757
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,232
There should be no resemblance this isn't medicine this is

758
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,000
Punishment

759
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,048
The firing squad

760
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,704
Is honest and acknowledges itself for what it is I have one objection to the traditional firing squad

761
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,240
Glad that you tie uses

762
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:30,848
He says he doesn't like the fact that one person get the blank and that nobody knows who that person is

763
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,152
That to me is symptomatic

764
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:37,248
Of our failure once again to take responsibility for what we do

765
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,528
Nobody should have a black

766
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,088
If we cannot face what we're doing

767
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,880
And acknowledge it

768
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
Then we shouldn't do it

769
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:57,472
And we may be coming to a moment where we are about to do that to look at this and acknowledge it

770
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,240
Because

771
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:03,872
In 2014 in a case that was really just about lethal injection just as viruses look like

772
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,408
Stop

773
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:10,528
Just talking about the details like questions about which medicine that we use

774
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:14,368
For the court to consider a basic question

775
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,696
Weather

776
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
Institution

777
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,512
In other words what he's saying is

778
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,632
It's time to talk about not just like the mechanics of what we're doing

779
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,728
But whether we should even do it at all

780
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:42,528
Reporter Karen Duffin

781
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:55,328
Now when Breyer said that in 2014 he was into the scent lost the case but

782
00:37:55,584 --> 00:38:01,728
A lot of people saw that statement as this invitation like Breyers saying to the lawyers of America send us case

783
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:08,128
In fact some of those cases have just started to arrive 2 days ago a case

784
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:14,528
Made it in front of the court almost made the US Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to hear in a few

785
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:20,928
Asserting that the death penalty violate the US Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment

786
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:27,328
Ruth Bader Ginsburg

787
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,888
They're on the way you're something else it happened while we were reporting this

788
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,424
Destroy this one for about 2 weeks ago

789
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,240
The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has announced

790
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:40,640
But it will no longer allow its drugs to be used in Lethal Injections

791
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,200
Market source of drugs used in execution

792
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,248
This basically

793
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,528
Cake white sage

794
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,856
Spells the end of lethal injection in the United States but it's closed

795
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,904
Because now any states that want to keep doing it

796
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,208
They essentially have to go underground

797
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,232
To get those drugs

798
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,144
More perfect

20th century

813
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,696

Charles W Baker an hour

816
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,816
Case was so dramatic

817
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,424
So traumatic there was an instance in which my

818
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:11,008
Brother found my father going upstairs to get a shot

819
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,592
But it actually ended up breaking to just

820
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,384
That is next week
