WNYC Studios

2
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,128
The Honorable

3
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,200
Supreme

4
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680
This is more perfect

5
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,704
I'm Jad abumrad

6
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,752
Today a little bit of a departure

7
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
Maybe it's more of an addendum

8
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,872
So we just released an episode about citizens united

9
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,920
Which is one of the most

10
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,456
Argued about cases

11
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,504
History in this this was a case

12
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,040
We lie about

13
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:27,808
1st Amendment

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,112
Whether we should limit the First Amendment

15
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,416
No in that case

16
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,952
He had this tension

17
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,720
Adjust

18
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,280
Is Kennedy who saying don't touch it don't touch it.

19
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048
Touch it

20
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,864
I don't care if all this money comes into our political system

21
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,656
Don't touch the first two men

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
BHS

23
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
Desoutter

24
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
Sing

25
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,568
I don't know maybe we should touch it because sometimes

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104
Your freedom

27
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,408
Impinges on my equality

28
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,968
And should those two things be in balance

29
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
It's a

30
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
Fascinating and

31
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
Important,

32
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
Station

33
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,392
And it was one that we were having internally

34
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,440
At the team while we were making that up

35
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
There's a certain point we decided

36
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,816
What sucks you take that conversation in

37
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
Make a live event

38
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
Something that we

39
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,936
We did a few times in the runner-ups

40
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
Season 2

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,752
We would have the public debates

42
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,544
Indy WNYC greenspace

43
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
I want to play you

44
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,896
Some excerpts from that debate

45
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,200
That we had about free speech

46
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,296
And we did it Sir Classic debate format one person took one side 1/4

47
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
Another

48
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
In a questions were

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,696
Should the government do more in this day in age to limit Free Speech should

50
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
Twitter

51
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,000
Dumor should face

52
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,560
Dumor should all of us collectively

53
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
Be doing more to stop

54
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,632
Dangerous hateful

55
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:49,984
Full speech or is this precisely the mum we have to stand up louder and prouder

56
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
Protect that

57
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
Speech even if we hate it

58
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
Two before we got into it

59
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
I took a poll the audience

60
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,992
Everybody thinks that you're right to free speech

61
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,552
Especially online okay people

62
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
Say some bad things

63
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
But you're right

64
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,416
To free speech

65
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,976
Should remain pretty much Unlimited

66
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,768
Those of you who feel that way

67
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
Make some noise

68
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,912
All right you guys are you guys are Thunders over here

69
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,240
Is it more accurate

70
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,032
Those of you who don't think should be limited go

71
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
Okay

72
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,944
Now those of you on the flip side those of you think there should be some clear

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
Hard

74
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
Limits

75
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
Easy easy

76
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,320
Don't you think there should be some clear limits

77
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
On what you can

78
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,392
Say online Make some noise

79
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,720
All right

80
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,744
Okay thank you

81
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
Good sense of where we're starting

82
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:51,680
All right let me introduce her to bitters for round one the question is should the government limit online free speech taking one side of that

83
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,960
Question is

84
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
Mr. Elie mystal

85
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,848
Are legal editor at more perfect also

86
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,640
And editor above the law

87
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
A site for legal newsies on one side

88
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
Of the stage

89
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
End of the question

90
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
On the other

91
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
Mr. Ken White

92
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,648
A First Amendment litigator criminal defense attorney at brown white and Osborn in Los Angeles

93
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
He has joined us here

94
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
From the Left Coast

95
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:20,863
He's a former Federal prosecutor he runs the free speech and criminal justice blog Pope at.com

96
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:25,215
All right

97
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519
Let us begin

98
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,615
What's up with you Ellie is there something wrong with the First Amendment would you say

99
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:37,759
I don't have a problem with the First Amendment it was a beautiful thing written for white people who want to overthrow the government site

100
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,599
I have a problem with absolutist

101
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,415
Who want to elevate threats harassment

102
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,951
Impulse for genocide

103
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
The level of a secret right

104
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:52,095
I do not think that the First Amendment prohibits us from preventing a Nazi

105
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
I'm getting a permit to Rally

106
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679
Any more than I would think

107
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
Did the Second Amendment prevents us

108
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,543
From having a sociopath not get a gun permit

109
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
Okay

110
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,615
Absolutism is

111
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,663
Absolutely wrong

112
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,943
Honda Civic

113
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,271
Okay element style strong beginning

114
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551
What do you think

115
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:17,695
Why don't know what absolute is Ellie is talking about the last one I know is Hugo Black and he died nineteen

116
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,999
Anyone we have well-established

117
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,023
Narrow

118
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Exceptions

119
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
For the first time

120
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,607
And they are narrow for a reason

121
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,655
We got them they rode On The Backs

122
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
The powerless

123
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,983
Being suppressed by the powerful

124
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
All of the types

125
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,567
The restrictions that Ellie would like

126
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,615
Are ones that have historically been used

127
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,943
Against communist against labor protesters

128
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
Against War protesters against minorities

129
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
And everyone else

130
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
The Nazis aren't the ones in danger

131
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
From the tight

132
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
Restrictions la

133
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,903
Is suggesting

134
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,231
Okay there are the two basic positions

135
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
Let's get the debate started

136
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,167
Alright Ellie start start a sock

137
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
Explain why you think that

138
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
Hateful speech fake news

139
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
Shouldn't be protected by the first

140
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,615
Can just admit it just agreed

141
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,407
That we already regulates

142
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
Speech at some love

143
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:16,063
So really all were debating about tonight the only thing that's even Up For Debate is where we want to draw that wine

144
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,135
Henwood draw that line so it protects

145
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
Nazis

146
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,975
I would draw that line so it protects

147
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
Us

148
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,023
From the knot

149
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
Let's start with a pretty simple example

150
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
Fire

151
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
Just kidding

152
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,519
I'm sure you've all heard that the thing that you can say

153
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,823
Is that you can't shout fire on the crowded theater

154
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
But actually Under Armour

155
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
Current laws

156
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,783
Probably can because our current standard is that what is unprotected or things that lead to direct inside

157
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
Excitement

158
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Eminem

159
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111
Lawless Acts

160
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
That's a very high bar

161
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,231
So I can probably say fire when I probably can't say is

162
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Fire

163
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
Kill who you must to survive

164
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
That would probably get me in

165
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:06,751
But the fire analogy comes from an older standard older than the one that I just quoted

166
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,055
It comes from Oliver Wendell Holmes

167
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
Some of you might

168
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,943
And his standard when he use the you can't falsely shout fire in a crowded theater

169
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Analogy

170
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,015
His standard was false

171
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
And dangerous

172
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
Speech that is

173
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,855
False and dangerous

174
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
Is not protected by the Constitution

175
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:30,559
I think that's where the Winans I think that's an eminently reasonable line I think that we had a hundred fifty years of a free republic with that line

176
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
So I want the line

177
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Where

178
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,911
Dangerous lies

179
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Or not

180
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
Protected by the

181
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,287
I don't want the government deciding what's a line of what

182
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,103
Trip may I remind you we are currently led by a President

183
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,199
Who thinks global warming is a Chinese hoax to Corner the tungsten

184
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,527
And that's why I don't want the government deciding

185
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
What to suppress based on its

186
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,415
Decision about what is true or not

187
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
Ellie refers

188
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,535
To the fire in a crowded theater Justice Holmes famous quote

189
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,863
Let's remember what he was talking about he was using that quote

190
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,655
You can't shout fire in a crowded

191
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:13,567
To justify jailing a man who is protesting World War II by handing out flyers suggesting that people

192
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
Just the draft

193
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,663
That was a clear danger that the government saw

194
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
If you don't think

195
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
That is plausible

196
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,575
That the government would be suppressing the same type of speech now if you gave it

197
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,367
The power if you handed it to them

198
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
Out of fear of not

199
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,719
Then just look at what happened after the protest

200
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
Just last year

201
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
The alt right

202
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
Annunaki

203
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,839
Rose there were massive protests

204
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Response

205
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,959
In our largely republican-dominated State legislatures leaped into action

206
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,495
And it's 17 places

207
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
They proposed

208
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
Heavily

209
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,103
Punitive anti-protest Bells

210
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,151
Including porch Army examples

211
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,479
Making it easier for you to get off if you run over a protester

212
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,295
That's what the government does

213
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
With the power to suppress

214
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,391
Speech when you let the government decide what

215
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,439
Trip I think you just proved

216
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,999
That our current first amendment standard doesn't do

217
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
Bull

218
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
To actually protect protest

219
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
All it does is protect Nazis

220
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,399
You want to talk about the Oliver Wendell Holmes case

221
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,703
What's talked about where our current standard come from

222
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,007
It's relatively recent 1969

223
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
Brandenburg V Ohio

224
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:20,639
Now what was that case I said 1969 you probably thought it was

225
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,967
We're making it know it was for Clans

226
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,271
Brandenburg was a klansman

227
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
He was all

228
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,831
Making plans Satanist

229
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:33,951
Somebody arrested his ass for being a klansman he got convicted for inciting violence

230
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
Anacortes

231
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
He's just a klansman

232
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,655
We really need a new standard that protects the right of plans men to threaten black people

233
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
In 1969

234
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
But you see

235
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
L you know that's not

236
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
How to write case

237
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
That's the one that's best

238
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
Your

239
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
The right cases

240
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,383
Is 12

241
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
The right case

242
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,943
What is 12 years earlier

243
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,967
Yates vs

244
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
People convicted

245
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,087
For becoming members of the Communist Party

246
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
Under the Siri

247
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,671
Some ideas can be punished

248
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
As clear and present danger

249
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,767
Even when there is no imminent advocacy

250
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
Wrongdoing Yates

251
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,863
Built the wall that eventually Brandenburg

252
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
Completed

253
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
Brandenburg V outlier

254
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:21,567
The one that shows how the power is consistently used by the government can you explain to me a sinner that allows me to stop playing

255
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
Cuz that's what I want

256
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
Like me

257
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:30,271
How I can make plans but not sitting in a field then I think we can agree more than we disagree

258
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
The first amendment is

259
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,367
Here to protect minorities are you kidding me

260
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:40,767
The Constitution even think about black people, 13th Amendment I think as we all know so okay you're saying that

261
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,327
You would like to change the standard so that

262
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,423
Will it help me understand okay

263
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,983
How would you have it what would the standard be

264
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
I can give you an example

265
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,543
The president is a canyon

266
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,895
That's balls but it's not particularly dangerous and so we can let that

267
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,431
Kind of slide right

268
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,271
Hillary Clinton is running a pedophile ring out of a pizza shop

269
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,111
Do not pass go do not collect 200

270
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
The monster

271
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
Okay babe

272
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
Bethesda to very clear examples

273
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,279
The idea of falseness and danger

274
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,303
Can get pretty squishy

275
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
I mean

276
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
Can I call up an example

277
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,167
If you get if you guys don't mind so

278
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
The daily Stormer

279
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239
Which is a very

280
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
Popular Neo-Nazi site

281
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,359
There was a situation where they basically took a Jewish woman

282
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,407
A real estate agent

283
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:33,759
That's the thing right there you can see on the screens and they superimpose it on image of Auschwitz

284
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,575
They published her name they publish her kids

285
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:41,951
They said hateful things like we will drive you to Suicide they called Fraser at Roloff

286
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
On her

287
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
Does that qualify for you and doesn't qualify for you

288
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
Can

289
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
Would you limit that kind of

290
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
I think a lot of the

291
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Comments

292
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,703
Sent her we're true threat

293
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,519
That is a reasonable person would see them as statements

294
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Actually 10

295
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,567
To do her harm

296
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,359
I think some of the speech about her

297
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,895
Miche incitement Stan

298
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
That is intended to

299
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,991
And likely cause imminent Lawless action

300
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Against

301
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,295
But ideas

302
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
However he

303
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
Can't be true or false

304
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
And it's not for

305
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
For the government to regulate

306
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
Weather ideas

307
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
Opinions

308
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:21,887
Are true or false

309
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,423
Real true idea

310
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,215
Climate change not real

311
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,799
This idea we can make these decisions I don't think that we need to

312
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,919
Your standard requires and I and I have unfortunately because I am black on the internet

313
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,967
I haven't fortunately had to deal

314
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
With some

315
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,551
True threats are not true threats some

316
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,903
Trying to wrestle with this issue when I go to the cops to try to ask

317
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
Production

318
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:49,023
Wrestle with this issue of what actually protected speech and what's actually not protect

319
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,327
Am I popping with the current standards

320
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,423
Is that basically wait until they start shooting at me before they stop them

321
00:12:55,935 --> 00:13:01,567
I want to stop them before they start shooting I want to stop them before they start driving their cars into crowd of protesters

322
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,103
Because by then it's too late

323
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,407
I want them to stop to but

324
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
Here's the problem

325
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,479
With a history of America being

326
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
What it is

327
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,551
With a power having been used in the past being

328
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,903
What is what possesses you to think that if you give this broader power to attached

329
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,463
The government it's going to be used the way you wanted to be

330
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,887
I'd rather have this debate in 2020

331
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,191
Okay

332
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,567
Is today all right now you've heard Ellie and Ken's points the question is

333
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,615
Did you change your mind

334
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
Who thinks

335
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,735
The government should limit what we say online with your Samoyed

336
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:51,231
Let me get those of you who actually lean farther in that direction over the course of this argument

337
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Let me hear from you guys

338
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,399
Stop lab you got a few views

339
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:05,311
Those of you who do not think there should be limits placed from the government by Us online buzzer

340
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,943
I think

341
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,479
We may have a winner

342
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
For the first round

343
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,087
I'm going to declare that you can white are the winner

344
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
4

345
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:24,767
First-round give it up for Ken white First Amendment attorney former Federal prosecutor and founder of Towpath.

346
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:29,375
Thank you for doing this gif

347
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,055
Pizza coming up we're going to ship

348
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
The question little bit

349
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
Set of asking

350
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
What should the government do about

351
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,455
Abbreviation of limited

352
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
Now we're going to ask what your Twitter

353
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
Did what your Facebook

354
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
You know

355
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,647
With all the fake news that's happening all the hate speech is collecting online

356
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
Should they limit

357
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
Free speech

358
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
More than

359
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,559
That is coming up after the break

360
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,863
More perfect

361
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,767
It's more perfect time Chatham rod

362
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
Let's get back

363
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,815
Back to our debate

364
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
A free speech debate

365
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,631
WNYC greenspace

366
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,447
Okay so round

367
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
2

368
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:41,311
We're going to take that same basic question that we asked around 1 but now we're going to transpose it

369
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
Whatever we think

370
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,127
About the First Amendment

371
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,919
It does Place limits on

372
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
The government

373
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,991
But not so much on Twitter

374
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,039
Are Facebook so the question is

375
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,623
Should Twitter and Facebook or other social media companies

376
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
Severely limit online

377
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,511
Or should they

378
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:05,119
I want to pull you guys for it's just against we have a baseline to start from

379
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,423
Those of you people watching on Facebook

380
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,031
Do you think the sight of which you are on right now should aggressively

381
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
Limit

382
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,847
The speech that you might type

383
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,175
Take take the online poll

384
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:23,039
Desert in the audience same question should Facebook and Twitter be allowed to severely limit

385
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
Online speech to find it as you will

386
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,767
Okay doesn't you think he'll know

387
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
All right

388
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,655
That's I guess

389
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,447
I got a kind of acid are mixed

390
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:46,079
Santa where we're at in the audience okay so here to debate this topic with Ellie is Karin mcsherry

391
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:52,223
Legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation which is committed to defending civil liberties in a digital world give it up for her

392
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:57,855
Alright so

393
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:02,207
Corrine look start with you why what do you think about the prospect

394
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,511
Twitter or Facebook stepping into

395
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
The takedown Liza

396
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Takedown hates

397
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,887
I think it's a very dangerous path

398
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,959
Fortunately we're already well along

399
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:19,615
I think in moments of Crisis and I think we're in a moment of Crisis right now we look to Simple Solutions for very complex

400
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
6 problems

401
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
And we are often

402
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
Sorry

403
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:26,527
And I think that is where we are right now the internet

404
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
Grew up

405
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,599
The way it did for mostly good

406
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
I would argue

407
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
Because

408
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,975
The platforms and the intermediaries mostly stayed

409
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
Neutral

410
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,791
If we have a world in which

411
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:42,655
Facebook Twitter Google Instagram put themselves in the position of a quart

412
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,447
Decide what speed should be up

413
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
What speed shouldn't

414
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,287
We're going to walk down a dangerous path because

415
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,591
Those decisions those tactics

416
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
Wood evitable

417
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
Be used

418
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,455
Against speech that we would support

419
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
For one thing

420
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,759
They will be inevitably

421
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:01,599
Used eventually by governments private censorship does not stay private

422
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
If it comes

423
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
Public censorship

424
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,439
Almost inevitably

425
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,743
And the third reason is really practical

426
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,559
They're already doing it and they're doing it

427
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
Badly

428
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:17,727
All kinds of Louisville speech is being taken down everyday Google and Facebook can't save us from the Nazis

429
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,751
We have to do it

430
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,335
Okay thank you Korean Ellie what do you think

431
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,687
The First Amendment does not apply to Twitter or Facebook

432
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,759
Anybody who tells you that they have a constitutional right

433
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,319
To say what they want on Twitter is an idiot

434
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,879
Which waterfalls Waze

435
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
They don't just want

436
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
Free speech

437
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
They want

438
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
Consequence

439
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
Free speech

440
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,559
They want to be able to say their vile trash

441
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,655
And still keep their jobs and still keep their homes and still get the girl

442
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,447
These people

443
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
All right

444
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:53,055
We should have Twitter at least at the level of a Jets game

445
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,687
Those are the basic sides

446
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
Start

447
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
The debate

448
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,319
Hiker and take us off

449
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,975
The problems here are legion and almost start with the ones that I that I just

450
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,255
Touch on briefly before

451
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,791
The reality is

452
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,095
That we can all target people that we hate right

453
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:22,495
Right now but if we think that the rules that Twitter and Facebook and all those guys are going to come up with are going to be used

454
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,031
I guess the beach that we support

455
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:30,431
We are foolish it's already happening Community standards complaints are used against valuable speed all the time I know

456
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,991
No because I hear about it everyday in my

457
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Job

458
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:40,159
Then the related problem to that is when you get your lawful speech taken down you don't have any options you don't know how to get your stuff

459
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,951
Put back up do we have courts

460
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,999
We don't have a right of appeal

461
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
We don't have any challenge

462
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:49,887
These performers have the right to host any speech they want they actually have the First Amendment right

463
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,679
The host any speech they want

464
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
But

465
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:59,103
I think his users we want him to use that right wisely that's not happening right now

466
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,663
User I want them to stop Nazis

467
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:08,063
That's really all I can learn about the and stop them from

468
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,367
Mercante

469
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,159
They can't that's foolish

470
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
Sorry

471
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,767
Lyndhurst

472
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:23,167
Here's why you know what I know they can't because they're trying and they're failing over and over they cannot tell

473
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:28,543
The difference between hate speech and Reporting on high-speed get taken down and suspended

474
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,079
When they're doing perfectly

475
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
Waffle

476
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:36,991
I think one of the reasons why this is so important that we demand better from Facebook from Twitter from Reddit

477
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,575
Is that the reason why we're seeing so many more Nazis now

478
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,391
Is because of these platforms have allowed them to organize

479
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,951
There was a reason why

480
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,255
The clan was on the decline

481
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,535
20 years ago

482
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,375
Because you because wearing a hood and going out to meet your friends the middle

483
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,167
Feel by Brandenburg did

484
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,471
Wasn't really how the modern society was going

485
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,543
Expedition Twitter and Facebook and the site and read it came along

486
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,591
And now they have a way to talk

487
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:07,711
Talk to each other and realize that no I actually hate black people too though so do I let's hang out

488
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,527
No screw these people there's no there's no cost

489
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:16,928
Too Short reason why Twitter should allow them to exist or Facebook or whatever there is no business reason why Twitter or face

490
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
Whatever she allowed

491
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,512
Get them the F out

492
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,048
You know what I think I think about it

493
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,864
One of these we heard in the wake of Charlottesville with a lot of

494
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,656
Please folks got radicalized online

495
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:31,776
So why would the prospect of them getting radicalized online what would bounce set out in terms of the

496
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
Failure

497
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,080
That these sites are doing

498
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
I'm curious if you talk more about

499
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,664
Okay so a couple things I just want to respond to

500
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,832
My view is if white supremacist and clansmen and Nazis are organizing I weigh before they were doing it out in

501
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:50,208
Public where I can see them and I can challenge them and I can respond to them and law enforcement will say the exact

502
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
Same

503
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:55,584
Think people who fight terrorism say it's much better for the for the you know the

504
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,680
People to speaking publicly for the radical to be radicalizing where you can see them

505
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,728
They're going to organize anyway

506
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
Okay

507
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:08,896
So would you rather do with a student secret on the open I prefer.

508
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,944
Going finally make their own Nazi website

509
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,016
Wright's make your own Nazi thing right so that when

510
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,320
Whenever I get tense agree with me

511
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:22,720
Whatever the government is ready to stop these people still of all pre-registered they would have all said

512
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,280
Indeed.com

513
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:32,960
So we can continue The Silo conversation that we're having right now which is a big part of where I want to see you try

514
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
I think that's

515
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:41,152
That sounds very nice and it's a good talking point but in reality I think that's very very dangerous for our society we need

516
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:47,552
People to be talking to each other when they only talk to people who agree with them they never change their mind

517
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:53,952
Proven time and time again I feel like that is such

518
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,976
A happy

519
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:01,376
Slappy white version of this story of if we just talked to these people we can convince them that maybe black people

520
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,424
Shouldn't be sent off to prison camp

521
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:10,336
Once or twice and the rest of the time they're running cars in the people it doesn't happen nearly not long enough

522
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,872
We have gay marriage equality now

523
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
Because people talk

524
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:19,808
But it helps what I want to answer Jazz question cuz I think what you're asking is for an

525
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:24,416
Example of why I'm worried about how I wanted you are worried against Elie's work

526
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
So the weather works

527
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:33,888
Mountain and the way that is likely to continue to work as this other social media companies employ a combination of humans and

528
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,472
Mostly algorithms to try to figure out what's bad speech and what's good

529
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
And they

530
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,264
Message

531
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:44,384
So they end up taking down this statement all white people are racist

532
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,200
As an example of hate speech but they won't take down

533
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,040
Puma show the previous ones this from a congressman

534
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:56,160
Who said not a single radicalized Islamic suspect should be granted enter measure of quarter

535
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,744
Etcetera etcetera nasty stuff right they can't tell the difference

536
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:06,144
And that's what happens in there is an app tips Republic I hope you guys are all propublica supporters and fans cuz they're great

537
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,960
They did a detailed study to look at Facebook

538
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,728
Whose policies

539
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,056
And they found out that among other things their training their moderators

540
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,872
2 in some instances protect white men

541
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,152
Over black children

542
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:23,040
Yes where we are right now that's what we want to endorse that's we want to encourage I don't

543
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,624
I will stipulate that there are many examples of them

544
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,208
Getting it wrong they get it wrong or not great at this

545
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
Job yet

546
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,328
But we live in a real world where the actual not talk about Twitter

547
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,352
We live in the world

548
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,888
Were the actual cops

549
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,984
Get it wrong every freaking day and in my most radical statement

550
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,288
I'm not saying let's get rid of the cops

551
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,824
Cuz they don't know what they're doing

552
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,200
No I'm saying let's get better cops and for Twitter I'm saying let's get better Twitter

553
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,504
So they don't get it wrong some

554
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,320
Do you want to talk about letting the perfect be the enemy of the good

555
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,904
Just because Twitter and Facebook have not gotten to the level

556
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,976
Yet whether able to effectively police seized

557
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,280
Doesn't mean they should just stop trying

558
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,096
What we have where we are right now is

559
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,376
Thousands of accounts

560
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,656
Are being suspended

561
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,680
Everyday

562
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:16,288
Let's just say a relatively small percentage of those are for perfectly lawful

563
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,336
That's a lot of waffles Peach

564
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,640
That's a lot that we have authorized

565
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:27,296
Twitter and Facebook and everyone else to take them and encourage them to and keep in mind I want to say one more thing that I said before but I'm

566
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
Want to emphasize it

567
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,112
Once we start down this path

568
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:36,512
You think that this is going to stay within the decision-makers at Silicon Valley you are dreaming I mean that's bad enough I'm not actually sure why

569
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
Why we all want

570
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,328
Silicon Valley to make decisions about what's pee

571
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
Peaches okay for

572
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
All the rest of us

573
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,680
What even got to start it's not going to stop there

574
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,984
Governments are going to come in when they see

575
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,800
That Google Facebook Twitter can easily take down

576
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,592
Accounts they're going to say okay

577
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,872
Could you do that for us

578
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
This doesn't

579
00:25:54,688 --> 00:26:00,064
Somebody needs to stop these people and I refuse to believe that we live in a country where

580
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,392
Take question here in the back

581
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:08,512
If Facebook emailed you and said you can be in charge of what

582
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,792
Considered you know

583
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,072
A speech that is either less

584
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,096
Afdah poorest

585
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
Taken down you could build

586
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,424
You know whatever team of people

587
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
Would you accept

588
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,472
That would you think that

589
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
But that could

590
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,032
Create something that

591
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,568
You would be satisfied with or not

592
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
Ofo

593
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,640
I was Queen of the world

594
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,200
Hard to turn that down

595
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,832
I think even I would have trouble in all instances being perfect about what was

596
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:39,488
Loss of speech and what wasn't sweet but that actually isn't my main concern is that even I could then potentially be required by a

597
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
The government

598
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,072
2 then use that algorithm

599
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:48,448
For other purposes and I'll be really dangerous but here's the one thing that I would say in this is where I think we agree

600
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,752
Is that if I was Queen of the world

601
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
And I was

602
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:57,152
Running any of these companies one of the things I would absolutely do

603
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,944
Is putting much better

604
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,968
Processes for

605
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,552
Appeal for people to challenge when things are taking down rocks

606
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,576
This isn't just a

607
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,344
Speech issue

608
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,136
It's a due process issue because

609
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,160
Let's face it

610
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:14,304
Of course these aren't you know official government forms we all understand that but nonetheless this is how we talk to each other

611
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,352
These are our public spaces

612
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,984
And in this public spaces it's really important when your account get suspended when you get taken offline

613
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,264
To be able to

614
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,824
Get back up what you're doing is perfectly legal

615
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,896
And right now the reality is and I know this cuz I hear from him

616
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:29,920
All the time

617
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:35,808
It's very confusing you don't know who to appeal to you don't know who you don't know why you're taking down half the time

618
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,832
And you don't know what

619
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,136
What to do on the far right

620
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:43,232
Hi I just wanted to get your opinions on

621
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
Money

622
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,048
Because I hear a lot of talk about the

623
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:46,816
Does being

624
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:51,168
A speech issue or not but I think we're platforms the social media platforms I think it's

625
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,192
Really all about money

626
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
And it's about

627
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
Followers

628
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,288
And young kids are getting rape threats and

629
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,360
Threats and that they eventually

630
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,664
End in suicide I think that this has to do

631
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,944
With money I think there's

632
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
A bigger issue

633
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
And I just don't

634
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,296
Hear anyone talking about it and I just wanted to know

635
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,320
Thought about that

636
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:12,416
I think that that's that's really a real pressure point cuz I think

637
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,208
Elijah Cummings

638
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,488
Genuinely so

639
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,536
Do you want comfortable making money from

640
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
From hate

641
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,168
But unfortunately we still have a problem and I'm going to give you a sample from an article I just read yes

642
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,312
Conversation Piece about Google and how it runs advertising and search and so on

643
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,848
From talking points memo

644
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:35,968
Talking points memo mentioned that you know one of the problems that they have because these processes are so a pig

645
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,272
They survived because of Google advert

646
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:42,880
Them to write their legitimate site trying to do good for the world they survive because of Google app

647
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,928
Advertising they keep getting penalized

648
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,976
For hate speech because they're reporting

649
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
On hate speech

650
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,536
Specifically Dillon

651
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
Dylann roof

652
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,328
Situation

653
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,912
So y'all read the robot.

654
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:59,776
But no it is because we agree to the robots are bad but I think that we can all agree that talking points memo

655
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,568
Is a decent site

656
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:07,968
Infowars on Heather had if Google and Facebook and whatever slam them

657
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,296
Why would that why would that be so hard

658
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,088
If you really don't think

659
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:17,184
That we yet have the technology and the resources necessary

660
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,208
In order to

661
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,488
Police

662
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,024
These sites better

663
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,328
How about we go the other direction how about we just out

664
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
People

665
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:30,496
How about you just if you can if you're going to view Twitter going to tell me you can't tell who's threatening to kill me

666
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,520
Just tell me where it is

667
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,824
Just tell me who it is and I will handle it myself

668
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,408
What's wrong with that

669
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,736
See now he's just trying to piss me off

670
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:46,368
So we're talking about is now a step further its

671
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,440
Social media companies and intermediaries by the way all the

672
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
People that you interact with

673
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,256
They take it upon themselves

674
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,280
Two out yet

675
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,072
Write to pierce your anonymity

676
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,632
That is profoundly profoundly dangerous

677
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:03,008
Anonymity Anonymous speech is the most probably the most important form of political speech that we have

678
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
The ability

679
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,056
To speak

680
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,336
Especially online

681
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:10,432
Without fear retaliation means that you have the ability to speak your truth

682
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,736
If we out people if we

683
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,760
Except

684
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:17,344
That social media companies should be judge and jury over that should just

685
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:22,464
Expose people to the world without any choice without any recourse because once your outage

686
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:26,304
Sting to have a society

687
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,328
Protect ourselves

688
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,352
From these people

689
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,888
It's called Shame

690
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,912
We could

691
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:34,240
Shame them into being part of the her

692
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:39,872
If I didn't want to be part of the hurt we could know who they are and say hey guess what you're no longer part of the hurt

693
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:44,992
Shame is a powerful weapon that we used to have a Twitter is taken away from us

694
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,016
And that is why these

695
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,296
These people are allowed

696
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,320
2 *

697
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:54,720
That weapon was also used to persecute minorities all over there and everything was always you

698
00:30:54,976 --> 00:31:01,120
Minorities at some point

699
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,168
We used to stop naughty that's just a

700
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:09,312
Walkthrough used to persecute minorities when they were paid by the hour or I'll call you from a good thing

701
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:14,176
The one thing we have always understood in this country and this is before the 1st Amendment

702
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,712
Is the importance

703
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,992
I'm anonymousspeech

704
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:20,576
All right let me just jump in for so I can leave out weave a question here on the right

705
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,856
I just want to say that like

706
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,928
Is there a moral reason

707
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
Twitter

708
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:27,744
The government

709
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,280
Lean towards

710
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,584
And I personally am someone who

711
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,352
Do you still have

712
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,120
Abhorrent

713
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,400
And I was raised

714
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,192
Is fundamental Trish

715
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,752
And My Views about gay people

716
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,032
Had I spoken them on

717
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
Probably would have

718
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
Put off some

719
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,640
And it was

720
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,664
Not Shane

721
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:46,944
The change my mind

722
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,224
Encountered

723
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,016
People who are engaging

724
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,808
Who treated me like a

725
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
Even though

726
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
Had back

727
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
Open Twitter

728
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,928
And it changed my mind

729
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,232
And I don't know if you guys familiar with the Westboro

730
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,512
Interstate Fateh

731
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,048
Casein one

732
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,352
They have really the worst views

733
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
71

734
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,400
Any group

735
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,680
Considers himself

736
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
And there

737
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,776
Person who ran their Twitter is a friend of mine

738
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
Megan Phelps

739
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
Roper

740
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
She has a great story

741
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,152
About how using Twitter

742
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,176
Essentially like

743
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,712
Spread terrible hate

744
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,504
Saying things like fake

745
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,552
God for aids for killing date

746
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,880
But it was through Twitter and through the argument

747
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,416
When she got in the through the relation

748
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
She got in

749
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,512
That she found a way out of that bubble she lived

750
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,792
And now is

751
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,096
Out in the world doing amazing work

752
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,656
If what you want Ellie happen

753
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:43,264
That's rule that you want to shut up that klansman do you want to get rid of

754
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,544
He doesn't go away

755
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,616
The mold grows in the shadow

756
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
And it's

757
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
Only in the Sun

758
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
You know it's only

759
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,248
It's only when you get it out in the open and we have this

760
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,016
Conversation

761
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,832
As a former believer and some of the stuff

762
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,160
I don't lose heart like we can have our minds J

763
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,696
We can we can

764
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,232
Be convinced

765
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,512
Of the truth

766
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:12,448
I respect her story and I'm very glad that some that you were able to

767
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,496
To to to get to where you are

768
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
However

769
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:22,176
Turns out that I believe what you want me to believe

770
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:25,248
For good so I don't know 2829 yours

771
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,016
Of my life

772
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,600
I am a 40 year old black man I am sick

773
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:33,696
Of being the educational PBS after school special

774
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,976
The racist white people

775
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:38,816
Gay people are sick of being the ABC Afterschool special for white people

776
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:45,472
Women are sick of being the after school special training teach the white man why they also should have rights

777
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,032
It is simply no longer acceptable

778
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:51,104
For you to expect other people just trying to go about

779
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
Posting their dinner

780
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,920
Recipes on Facebook

781
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:57,504
It's ridiculous for you to think that we should still have

782
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,320
The burden of educating you

783
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,368
You should go get educated somewhere

784
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,672
That can't be on us all the time

785
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,744
And I'm willing to do it I'm willing to do it here

786
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,120
I'm a hater I'm willing to do it in in in public I'm actually I'm leaving to go to a bar

787
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,144
And have a drink with

788
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,936
People that I can't stand

789
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:20,800
But at some point when I just want to like get on Facebook and see the Mets score

790
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,104
I shouldn't have to hear your b*******

791
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,896
Okay

792
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:26,944
I think that was what

793
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,968
He was saying

794
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,504
At all

795
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,808
Microphone

796
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,904
I think he was just saying silos bad

797
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:42,816
We should all be together and then

798
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,096
No I think that

799
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,424
No I think we don't talk to each other

800
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,960
Nobody's mind Everett

801
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728

803
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,664
Wait you guys

804
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,968
Who thinks that

805
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:04,064
Twitter and Facebook and said should take a strong hand in severely limiting online

806
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,184
He says that you think so clock

807
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:13,024
Those of you who disagree with the a****** clapping to your left

808
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,816
Make some noise

809
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:21,216
I believe that mean

810
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:27,616
Means that you are the victor

811
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:34,016
Thank you to all
