WNYC Studios

2
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:50,688
Is more perfect time Chatham rod cell

3
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:54,016
Last season we profiled a guy named Edward bloom

4
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,576
This is a guy who

5
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,624
According to his critics

6
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:04,000
Had almost single-handedly roll back Decades of civil rights law

7
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,888
Wasn't a lawyer wasn't politician but somehow he sort of found this way

8
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,936
To play the courts

9
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,728
2

10
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,544
Hook up just the right case find just the right plaintiff

11
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:21,920
Target voting rights affirmative action all kinds of different laws that take race into account

12
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:26,784
Same to us the time that he was sort of the Hidden architect not too much was known about him

13
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,112
In fact at the time that we did the story

14
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,976
There is a big case of his targeting affirmative action that was coming before The Supreme Court

15
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,280
And there was he this moment or his plaintiff

16
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
Play two feet found

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,608
Young white woman Abby Fisher was on the steps

18
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,632
Supreme Court

19
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424
Giving an interview and

20
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,752
He would literally be behind her in the shadows

21
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,544
Almost at the edge of the frame

22
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
Which ones to know like

23
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,616
Who is this guy

24
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,152
What's the story

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,992
So we produce a profile

26
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,040
And what I'd like to do

27
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,088
This podcast is update that broke

28
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
Because

29
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,952
Recently I talked to Ed bloom again about what he's up to now

30
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
And it's really

31
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
Pinterest

32
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,816
Maybe traveling depending on where you stand

33
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
So

34
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,632
Going to play

35
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,912
A chunk of the original

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,800
Justice recepta contacts and then follow up with a new interview in or if you'd rather not hear the original

37
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,080
Skip 2 minutes

38
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
17

39
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
Otherwise

40
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,224
Producer Katherine will start this off again we wanted to know like who is this guy

41
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,760
Since you paid him a visit

42
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
Yeah so I

43
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,320
Went to Tallahassee

44
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
That's where you live

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,744
He Winters in Tallahassee

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,048
You walking what initially struck you

47
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
Golden Retriever

48
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
Is what initially

49
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
Hysterectomy

50
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,984
Literally physically laugh

51
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
And

52
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,872
I don't know what I was expecting but when you hear about these cases you know

53
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664
Critics are really

54
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
People are mad about

55
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,832
It is deeply disturbing truly outrageous to betray the American people

56
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,392
So I go to meet him and your flight

57
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,672
From Austin

58
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440

59
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,744
To Tallahassee uneventful and

60
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:16,864
On time and good looks like a totally nice guy

61
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
A regular guy

62
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
Was it look like

63
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,496
Like a dad there's something in me that just loves

64
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,544
Tradition and Custom

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,848
Listening to the Great American Songbook

66
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Beautiful

67
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,432
Frank Sinatra

68
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,968
As long as I hope

69
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:36,320
And Ella Fitzgerald

70
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,112
I love

71
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,952
Art and Museum Independent films golf

72
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,232
What's the skies backstory

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,096
Well he's 64 I was born in a small town

74
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
In Michigan

75
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:56,032
My dad owned a shoe store their my mom worked with him in the shoe store

76
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
Cleaning up

77
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,664
The first Republican my mother ever met

78
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,064
How to use the word typical but it it really was a typical liberal Jewish

79
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
Household

80
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
My mother and father

81
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,416
Where Franklin Roosevelt

82
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,464
Harry Truman Democrat

83
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,512
Always

84
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,815
Democrat when he said he was

85
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,119
That way to all the way through college

86
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
The University of Texas

87
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,471
Grad school University of New York where I am

88
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,543
Spent a year studying of all things

89
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
African literature

90
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,455
But he says somewhere along the way his political leanings

91
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
Started started to shift

92
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
I spent

93
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
A summer in Israel

94
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,855
Living Mana

95
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,183
And he says he came out of that experience

96
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,743
A little less liberal than he was before

97
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,423
And you got married and then in the early 80s he's living in Houston working as a stockbroker

98
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
And

99
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
We met

100
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,055
Aren't our neighbors

101
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,967
This particular couple they were New Yorkers who would move to Houston both grew up as

102
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:14,367
Liberals and the guy she sort of opened my eyes to the world

103
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:20,767
World of the Neo cons

104
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:27,167
Show review commentary magazine conservative magazines and this was around the time that the neocon movement was really hitting it

105
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,703
Stride you got all these

106
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
New York liberals

107
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
Defecting

108
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
Is what he says

109
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Thousand

110
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103
Individuals who grew up in the night

111
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
1960s

112
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
It started to question

113
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
The Wiz

114
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
Obviously

115
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
Liberal policies

116
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,783
And he says slowly

117
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
Overtime

118
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
Very

119
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
Gradual

120
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
He became one of those people

121
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
In any case

122
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:54,047
Fast forward a little bit he's living in Houston Garden variety

123
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,071
Existence

124
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
And

125
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,167
Something happens that sends him on this entirely New Path

126
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,983
Basically he and his wife moved to a new neighborhood

127
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,799
They move from the suburbs into the downtown area

128
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
Urban and

129
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,871
In 1990

130
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
We went to vote

131
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,735
For the first time in our new neighborhood

132
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,343
I realized that the Republican Party had not

133
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,135
Fielded a candidate

134
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
To oppose the Democrat

135
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
Incumbent

136
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
Running for congress this is a

137
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
District that has

138
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,839
Almost 600 thousand people

139
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,471
You don't have a choice you've only got one person running

140
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,775
Bloom decided to run himself

141
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
I lost item

142
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
No great surprise to anyone

143
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
He actually lost by 32 point

144
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,735
But along the way something really unusual happen

145
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:51,391
During that campaign he and his wife Lark you know they decided they were going to go meet voters in there.

146
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
They got a giant print out

147
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:59,839
Of all the addresses in the 18th congressional district

148
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,167
Started going door-to-door meeting people handing out literature

149
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,751
And I'd walk down say Oak Street take

150
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,079
The even side of Oak Street

151
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:15,199
And my wife would take the odd-numbered side of Oak Street

152
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:21,599
And we would start to walk and very quickly they realized that

153
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,391
The district shape

154
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
Was funny

155
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:29,279
Some houses on one side of the street would be in the district in the house is on the other side wouldn't

156
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,071
Sometimes the district would

157
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,631
McDonough Highway caption apartment complex

158
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,911
Come back at it just

159
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:41,567
Didn't make sense of this is large bloom wife of Edward Bloom this peculiar because we had

160
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,615
Maps we had to follow

161
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,199
And it was very odd the way some streets were

162
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
And the districts in somewhere

163
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:55,391
Took a while for it all to really sinking as to how this could happen I guess a better week of this

164
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,439
We realized that

165
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
Neighbors

166
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,791
Had been separated

167
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:06,399
Almost house by house because of their race

168
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,519
You come to believe that the reason this was done

169
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
Was

170
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,591
For the explicit purpose to create a majority

171
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
African American

172
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,503
This is an untrue

173
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:28,159
Clothes from a clear and simple wrong part of the reason this was done was the Voting Rights Act of nineteen

174
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,999
Of Americans are denied

175
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,327
The right to vote because of their color

176
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,727
This act was a giant step forward in civil rights one of the primary

177
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:46,079
Eliminate barriers to voting like poll taxes and literacy tests

178
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,639
Strategies that have been used to keep minorities

179
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
Facebook voting

180
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
And the other thing it did

181
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,551
Sort of in a roundabout way through a series of interpretations is

182
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,647
Encourage the creation of districts where the majority of Voters

183
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,951
Were minorities and that's because

184
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,535
One of the strategies that have been used previously to

185
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,167
Dilute the minority was to take minority communities and

186
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
They call it cracking later

187
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,007
They split them apart into many different discs

188
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
So that they were never

189
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
In the majority enough

190
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,615
Electorate

191
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,943
So the Voting Rights Act tried to correct that

192
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:28,319
The 18th congressional district was one of these majority-minority District

193
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
The district

194
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
Ron by the Texas

195
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
I do have a slight

196
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,487
African American majority

197
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,047
I think about 51% African American

198
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,887
But this was the problem according to bloom the way they got to that

199
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
African American majority was by

200
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,007
Creating this District that zigzagged all over the city and cut through neighbor

201
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,311
I could not understand

202
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:54,687
People live close together they could send their kids to the neighborhood schools they shopped in the neighborhood

203
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,991
Shopping centers they were worried about

204
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
Neighborhood issue

205
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,575
Brixies neighborhoods

206
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
Heart by race

207
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,927
Seemed so wrong to me

208
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,767
In his mind this law was actually

209
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:14,655
Not limiting discrimination but actually perpetuating

210
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,703
I don't know what a

211
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,775
The average person upon realizing this would have done

212
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
I decided

213
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,335
To file a lawsuit

214
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:30,527
Decided to sue the state of Texas called a few friends who lived in the 18th District

215
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:36,927
Racially diverse group of people African-American Hispanic

216
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:43,327
No I found a lawyer that I can afford $7,000 a month we filed a lawsuit challenging the con

217
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,727
Constitutionality Texas's redistricting plan

218
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:55,103
But now it was being used as an excuse to segregate people into racially polarized District

219
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,199
It worked its way through the lower courts and

220
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
Tonight

221
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,527
Shocked and surprised

222
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
In 1995

223
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,487
Number 94805 George W bush vs Alvera of the Supreme Court

224
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,887
Look it up

225
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
AR

226
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,263
Components step to the lectern and

227
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,663
Is the constitutionality of three congressional districts they make their arguments

228
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:36,063
Texas basically said all we have to put people together by race

229
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,111
Legislature has the obligation

230
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,975
To satisfy Federal requirements requirements

231
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,583
Like remember the Voting Rights Act we're trying to make sure that there are enough minorities in this District

232
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,703
So that they have a chance to elect a representative or advocate

233
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,847
May I please the court his arguments

234
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
But look at the map

235
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
The map is

236
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
Bizarre

237
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,735
And the only reason

238
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
It could have gotten this way as

239
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,807
Because you're only thinking about race

240
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,087
Only race

241
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:13,951
Think about it that seems messed up isn't that messed up it doesn't matter what your ultimate goal is

242
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
You cannot use

243
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:21,631
Forbidden tools rate is forbidden by the 14th Amendment to be used as a tool

244
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:28,031
A very tense situation

245
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,767
So in the end

246
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:53,631
Supreme Court

247
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,191
Hair-splitting decision

248
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,519
But I think it's at this deeper question that

249
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,567
In our society

250
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,895
Discourse we just haven't figured out how to talk about in a way

251
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:10,527
You don't look if you're defining race just as the color of someone's skin

252
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:16,927
The government cannot use that in any way that's against the constitution on the other hand if you take the

253
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:23,327
This wider View and you look at race in the context of History social context then

254
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,935
How can the government address discrimination without taking race into account that they have to

255
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
So it's difficult balance

256
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
You can't look at race

257
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
But you have to

258
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
And

259
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,639
The Supreme Court says to Texas look

260
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,223
All you're doing in this case is sorting People based on how they're labeled on us

261
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,343
You're not looking at that wider context you're not looking at if he's communities with next to each other

262
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
Common interest

263
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,671
You're just sorting them based on

264
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,719
Race alone and that's not good enough

265
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
You can't do that when the

266
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,303
Pinyin came down

267
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,631
The Supreme Court ruled in our favor 5 to 4

268
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,935
That was quite

269
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,471
A day

270
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
The day that we won that lawsuit

271
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:09,663
I was going to stream

272
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Hooked

273
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:16,831
Forever after that Edward Bloom decided that this would be his bank became

274
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:23,231
Must you use the court to try to strike down every race-based policy he could

275
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:29,631
Name was taken on the road I recruited plaintiffs in New York Virginia South Carolina

276
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,935
Try not to challenge congressional district

277
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:38,335
Plans and we won in each of those states he helped Sue school districts in Florida and Texas

278
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:44,735
To end the use of racial quotas in K through 12 magnet schools

279
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:51,135
Houston city Contracting to kill affirmative action

280
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,231
Fails but I've been the architect of over two dozen lawsuits

281
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
Six of which

282
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
Sex

283
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,071
Made it to the Supreme Court

284
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
Including

285
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:08,287
In 2013 in a 5-2 for vote very divided Florida Supreme Court today struck down

286
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
He parts

287
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:15,455
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 Supreme Court struck down a very important part of the Voting Rights Act

288
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:21,855
Tri 1965 Landmark lock is considered one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation

289
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,695
They Shoulda never pass Shelby County vs holder this decision

290
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,743
Gutted the Voting Rights Act

291
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,303
Specifically there was just part of it that said

292
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,607
States and counties with a history of discrimination

293
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,911
How to check with the federal government first

294
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,007
Before they go about changing their voting laws basically the federal government was saying look

295
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,567
You've been up to all this stuff we're now we're watching

296
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
Supreme Court said

297
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
You know

298
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
Time for change

299
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,991
That list was made a long time ago and

300
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
It's update

301
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
This decision

302
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:56,671
Restores an important constitutional order to our system of government

303
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,975
This was Bloom's biggest victory

304
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,255
When Shelby County

305
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,703
I think a lot of people burst into tears when I came down and I understand it

306
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,983
Disturbing

307
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,263
Deeply disappointed

308
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
Deeply disappointed

309
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,687
With the Court's decision in this matter

310
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,271
Change during the Civil Rights Movement people died

311
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
For the precious right to vote

312
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,367
This is congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston to

313
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:33,023
I would like to have the Supreme Court Justices go back in time go back in

314
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,655
Sometime and March with those who March after Bloody Sunday

315
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,447
I from Selma to Montgomery

316
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,495
A balloon has a right to his opinion

317
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,823
It doesn't mean that it has to be the opinion of the United States

318
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
I understand that

319
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,407
People were in a

320
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
Gravely upset

321
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,479
I also know that they were

322
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
People who were Gravely relieved

323
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
And Gravely

324
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
Ratify

325
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,159
Yeah but I think what gets a lot of people

326
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
Is it

327
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
You look at the Civil Rights

328
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
Videos you see tens

329
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,839
Thousands 40,000 people in the streets marching and

330
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,143
You hold that if you make a split screen in your mind

331
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,703
Hold that thousand ten thousand people in one side

332
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,983
On the other side

333
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
You one guy

334
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,591
It does make you ask basic questions about tomorrow

335
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,127
That's a false paradigm

336
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,175
It's

337
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,759
That maybe your split screen but that's

338
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Really not

339
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,391
Good luck in 1964 19-6

340
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,255
America was held hostage

341
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
Bye

342
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,327
The legacies of slavery

343
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
And the

344
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
Choke hold

345
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,167
Jim Crow

346
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
Fast

347
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Forward

348
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,031
To 2006

349
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,079
The reauthorization

350
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Of

351
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
The Voting Rights

352
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663
The chokehold

353
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
Had gone

354
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
Away

355
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,831
African Americans in the Deep South registered to vote

356
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
In numbers

357
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415
Often exceeded

358
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,231
Participated in elections

359
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,023
In numbers that

360
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
Exceeded

361
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
In terms of

362
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,143
Electoral opportunity

363
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,679
We have

364
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
Come

365
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,007
180 degrees

366
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:19,775
From

367
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:26,431
1960s degrees because of the law which you helped overturn an indent and we don't know

368
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,527
To what degree that is the psychology of America changing or the fact that we had a lot

369
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,319
Cat people online

370
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:38,719
And now that love has gone and now we see voter ID laws coming back into play which I think any like saying purse

371
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,791
Admit is it is it is it is an attempt a blatant attempt

372
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
Disenfranchised

373
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:47,167
People do it feels a little bit strange that two I mean I completely agree with your things have gotten better

374
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
Same time I think

375
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,263
Well that was because of the wall That's now gone

376
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:55,103
Look laws change laws

377
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
Evolve

378
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,431
+ and at some point

379
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,991
They need to come to an end

380
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,951
So after winning the Shelby County case

381
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,279
Ed Blum turned his attention to

382
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,607
Affirmative action good universities be able to

383
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:23,007
Racial preferences in college admissions you found a young white woman named Abigail Fisher

384
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,079
Race may have hurt her chances to attend the University of Texas

385
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:32,479
There were people in my class with lower grades to Warren and all the activities I was in who were being accepted into UT and

386
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,295
The only other difference between us what color are skin

387
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,087
Case goes to the Supreme Court

388
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
And in that case

389
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:45,279
The Supreme Court has upheld the affirmative action program at the University of Texas

390
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,815
Who is constitutional

391
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,095
Ed Bloom law

392
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
But

393
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:55,007
At the end of that original piece he made it clear to us he wasn't giving up I'm a long distance Runner

394
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,615
If there's something just emblematic about my personality

395
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
Run

396
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
Long distance

397
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,271
And even as the court was coming down with his decision against him

398
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,319
He was planning his next move

399
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
That's coming up next

400
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:19,327
This is my perfect MCAT I will bring the action up to the present

401
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,935
After Ed Bloom lost that Supreme Court case against University of Texas last year

402
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
He kept the case going on the state level

403
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,055
And he took aim at two more schools

404
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
I have

405
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,383
Retain counsel to litigate

406
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,431
Harvard's admission policies in

407
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,479
University of North Carolina admissions

408
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:41,599
He formed an organization called students for fair Admissions and this time

409
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,927
The target was perceived discrimination against

410
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,207
Asian-American

411
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,815
Case against Harvard is in the early stages but I recently called them up

412
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863
You just kind of get an update

413
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
On this

414
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,655
Crusade

415
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:58,751
The ultimate goal is to have the Supreme Court revisit it

416
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,079
We can come fortunate opinion in Fisher

417
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,127
And in the use of race and ethnic

418
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
Once and for all

419
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,223
That's the goal of this organization in this organization

420
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
Mistake

421
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
Active until that

422
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,599
Is this a situation where lie quiz

423
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,903
Utu

424
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,184
Italy recruited plaintiffs

425
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
Yes

426
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
It is it is

427
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,280
So I did

428
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
With

429
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
Students

430
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
For fair admissions

431
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
What

432
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,400
I did with

433
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,680
The University of Texas

434
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,728
And that is

435
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
Working with

436
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
Friends

437
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,312
And allies

438
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,104
Tofu

439
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,456
Yearn for the day that race and ethnicity is not a part of the University admissions

440
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,504
Set up three new website

441
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,344
Harvardnotfair.org

442
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,160
UNC not fair

443
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,952
. org

444
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,488
And UW

445
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,512
Not fair

446
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,816
. org W being

447
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,840
Wisconsin

448
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,376
So it was

449
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Our Hope

450
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:04,800
Define students who had been rejected from those three schools willing to join students for fair admissions

451
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,592
And let us proceed

452
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,872
Into Federal

453
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
And that's that's

454
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
What we did

455
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,272
Ed told me he got hundreds of responses to these websites

456
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,088
From students who felt like they've been discriminated against

457
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,696
He went out of town to just students he felt had the most Merit I talked to the kids

458
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,488
I talked to their parents

459
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,072
Each of those kids and their parents who agreed

460
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,864
To join

461
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,632
And

462
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
Participate

463
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
As

464
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,984
What about participating member in a lawsuit

465
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,312
I got on a plane and went to

466
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
This is weather

467
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:42,688
Learn about their background let them ask me questions and who are they

468
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:47,296
What can you tell me about the for the Harvard case they are all Asian

469
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,112
Many of them are

470
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,184
Children of immigrant

471
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,488
Chinese

472
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Children of

473
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,584
First generation Korean and Vietnamese

474
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,376
And they have

475
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,168
Superlative academic records

476
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,472
Startlingly

477
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
So

478
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,776
Perfect GPA

479
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,104
Perfect SATs in a CTS

480
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
Activities

481
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
Sports

482
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,944
Lots of volunteer effort

483
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,272
And how many how many of them are directly associated with the case

484
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:24,416
That is something that the judge in the Harvard case has placed

485
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
Undersill

486
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,720
Wisely

487
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
What I think

488
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,280
Well

489
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:33,376
We remember what happened with the

490
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,424
The harassment

491
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,496
Of Abigail Fisher

492
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:43,104
If you don't take your little ass on somewhere different Grace didn't suck your dumbass

493
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,944
Maybe you would have gotten into a good college Becky with the bad grades

494
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,016
Really happy you and your racist lawyer got shot down

495
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,296
Abby was

496
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
Hounded

497
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
Abby

498
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
Was

499
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
Threatened

500
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,232
We learned an important lesson

501
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,256
And that is

502
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,072
Although there may be students

503
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
Who are

504
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,680
Brave enough to put their name on a lawsuit

505
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
The consequences

506
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
Canby

507
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,520
Dangerous

508
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
And frightening

509
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,872
So all of the students involved in those

510
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,896
Three cases

511
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:17,920
Harvard

512
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
UNC

513
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,480
And the University of Texas

514
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:21,760
Have

515
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:22,784
Standing

516
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,856
As members of the organization

517
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,392
And their names

518
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,928
Their addresses

519
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
Their email will never be made to the public

520
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,304
It's a funny thing though because

521
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,352
I mean the idea of a

522
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
Plaintiff

523
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,400
Even if it is

524
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,192
Often

525
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
Pecan extract

526
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:49,408
Strange to have plaintiff's that you can't examine and that you can't say OK Google who are they

527
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,688
Exactly what others

528
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,760
And you're right Abigail Fisher

529
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
I think was

530
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,064
Is the subject of some very high

531
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
Kind of harass

532
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,440
The same time who she was was a helpful starting point for

533
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,232
For the conversation about whether this should

534
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
Exist

535
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:08,864
Informative action or whatever you would call this doesn't happen in the corded happens in the world that have

536
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,400
Society in this is something that is

537
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
Affects all of us

538
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,216
Well this is

539
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,240
Very common

540
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
And Federal

541
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,800
The ACLU

542
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
Which is a membership

543
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
Often

544
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,128
Suzhou

545
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,176
In the name of the organization

546
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,248
Disclosing only to the courts

547
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,784
Their members who have been Direct

548
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
Actually harmed by the

549
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,112
So what we're doing is Not Unusual

550
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
Yatchan

551
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,696
Okay so you said in interviews

552
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
On this lawsuit.

553
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,536
Asian American students are being penalized for being a

554
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
High-achieving minor

555
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,096
How do you argue

556
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
That they're being Penal

557
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,912
Well in litigation like this

558
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,704
We know that the court

559
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,776
Allows the use of race and ethnicity in admissions

560
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,312
What we also know

561
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
Is that

562
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,104
You cannot

563
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,384
As a university

564
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,408
Have

565
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,176
2

566
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,712
Heavy of a hand

567
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,504
Using race and ethnicity

568
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
And

569
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
Furthermore

570
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,344
Numerica

571
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
Quotas

572
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,416
Are completely forbidden

573
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,488
And how we show that Asians are being

574
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,768
Target in the harbor

575
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,584
Is to look at the number of Asians

576
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,376
Applied to Harvard

577
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,168
What percentage

578
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,728
Year after year after year

579
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
Has Harvard admitted

580
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:23,872
And what we have found is it from 1992

581
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,664
True 2013

582
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,968
The

583
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,040
Percentage of Asians at Harvard admit

584
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,600
Has been remarkably

585
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
Flat

586
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,976
In fact in 1990 to 19%

587
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,304
Harvard's freshman class

588
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
Was Asian

589
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,424
Wow in 2013

590
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
18%

591
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,240
Oration

592
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,288
Now that doesn't mean much

593
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,568
Until you realize

594
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,128
That the number of Asians

595
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,408
Applying to Harvard

596
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,712
During this period of time

597
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,248
Better than doubled

598
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:06,368
Just a quick note here Harvard hasn't actually released data on ethnicity and admissions for

599
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,928
The years he was talking about so we can't confirm the numbers

600
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,464
Fuse we know that

601
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
Ed Loomis

602
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
Drawing

603
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,536
In part from the

604
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,816
National Center for

605
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,584
Education City

606
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
To the government

607
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:21,216
And by the way when he says 19% of the Freshman Class

608
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,008
Turns out the number

609
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
Using reverse

610
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,056
2 more than just for

611
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,640
If those kinds of data point

612
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,200
We're presented in court

613
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,736
In an employment

614
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,504
Lawsuit

615
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,808
Dude against a major corporation like

616
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
Walmart

617
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,880
Walmart would lose

618
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:42,208
Any judge would look at that and say you've got to

619
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
Quota

620
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
Walmart

621
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:44,768
Your

622
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
Employment Practices

623
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,328
Fall afoul of

624
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,352
Title 7

625
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,888
Let me just push back against f

626
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,472
You know immediately that idea lyrics

627
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,240
Expressing

628
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,288
And the and the start of the fight

629
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,848
The spirit of the lawsuit is premise on this idea

630
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,872
If you take away race

631
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,968
Filtering in admissions that what we would have is a more meritocratic

632
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,760
Australian grades

633
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,064
But I mean

634
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,112
Hasn't the meritocracy

635
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
Isn't that true

636
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,184
Just a myth I mean especially in a place like

637
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,000
Like Harvard I mean if you look at the data at Harvard you see that

638
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,072
People whose parents went to Harvard we have family members who went to Harvard

639
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,608
They get preference

640
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,400
Treatment in the admissions process

641
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,680
If you take that out just

642
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,728
It's a few wrongs okay people who have

643
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
Families

644
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,312
It can afford to send them to Kaplan prep courses

645
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,848
Is for the standardized test

646
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:37,248
They get a better like up and isn't that just kind of affirmative action for white people so that there's two ways I want to answer

647
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,296
The first is that

648
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
It is

649
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,112
Not up to me

650
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,904
It is not up to this organization

651
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,744
To dictate how Harvard or

652
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,280
Texas or

653
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:53,632
University of North Carolina fashion their admissions policy

654
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,192
The only thing legally

655
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,240
That we are advocating for

656
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
Is

657
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,592
The end of racial distinctions in the admissions

658
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
Process

659
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,408
Number two

660
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,944
I agree

661
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
Glad

662
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,504
Colleges and universities

663
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
Cannot

664
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,808
Use just

665
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
Strictly

666
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,880
Grades and SAT scores

667
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,416
As an admissions correct

668
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,232
I believe of Legacy preferences

669
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,280
Should have been ended at Harvard

670
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,072
And throughout the country

671
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
Decades

672
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
Citgo

673
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,424
I think people who write big checks

674
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,704
Do universities

675
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,032
Whose children then get a leg up in the admissions process

676
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,312
I think that audit

677
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,128
I think the colleges and universities

678
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,664
Have an obligation

679
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,200
Reach Out

680
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,504
Kids from disadvantaged background

681
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,296
Kids whose

682
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,880
Family income is too small and blowout

683
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,184
Whose parents didn't go to college

684
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:53,024
Who maybe grew up in a tough neighborhood

685
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,096
Colleges should use that

686
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,376
And not race

687
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,168
If they're going to give

688
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,192
A leg up

689
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:00,960
Yan

690
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,496
Helping kids from

691
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,032
These disadvantaged background

692
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
That means

693
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,896
That there will be lots of African-American kids lots of Hispanics

694
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,200
Lots of Asians

695
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,736
And lots of white kids

696
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:17,344
You know a helping hand from Harvard and Princeton and Yale and stand

697
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:22,464
There is no reason why an Asian applicants to Harvard

698
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
Who's

699
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,792
Parents are laborers

700
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,144
Mom works as a maid at a hotel in New York

701
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,680
And dad works

702
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:34,240
As I'm kitchen worker at a Chinese restaurant

703
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:38,080
There is no reason why that kid should be penalized

704
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,384
And white kids

705
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,480
African American kids and Hispanic kids who come from professional backgrounds

706
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,248
To be elevate

707
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,832
Ending racial classifications and preferences

708
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,880
And instead substituting

709
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,928
Socio-economic preferences

710
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,976
Is something that both the left

711
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,256
And the right can agree

712
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,608
But it's interesting to think about what might happen in the transitional

713
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,376
Space

714
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,448
Between say and Ed Bloom victory

715
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,008
And that remedied

716
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
Ignition switch

717
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,824
Cuz I was just thinking I might okay so take

718
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,592
Sexy men like

719
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,896
Abigail Fisher in with holder in the rights

720
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,432
Left side remind

721
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,224
Let's say you get

722
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,760
The harbor case to scotus

723
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,040
And you win

724
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
And

725
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,880
The court agrees that there is some kind of quota and place

726
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,672
Any longer support that

727
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:30,560
There should not be any kind of limit on high how many high-achieving Asian-American students get into Harvard

728
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
Or any University

729
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:36,192
It's interesting to think of the effect that might have on white applicants

730
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,216
Like

731
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,776
Abigail Fisher we make this

732
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
Argument

733
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,568
In our lawsuit

734
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,872
The argument is that

735
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,152
African Americans

736
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,432
Hispanic

737
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
And white

738
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,272
Are getting a preference

739
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
Over

740
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,832
Better qualified

741
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
Asian app

742
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,160
So it is very likely

743
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,928
And white

744
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:02,048
Seaweed you asserted that in our lawsuit

745
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,864
This is not an attempt

746
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,144
2

747
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,192
Reinvigorate

748
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,240
White applicants

749
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,032
All of the ivy league

750
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,824
Schools like Duke

751
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
Stanford

752
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,432
The number of whites as likely to go down

753
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,712
The number of Agents

754
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,736
Likely to go up

755
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
ATS

756
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:26,880
That's why we don't have any whites as plaintiff's in our Harvard lawsuit

757
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,184
That's why none of the kids

758
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,488
