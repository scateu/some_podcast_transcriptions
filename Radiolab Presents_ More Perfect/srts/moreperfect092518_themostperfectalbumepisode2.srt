1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:05,888
WNYC Studios

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
And when I first heard about this project I was hanging out with my mom and Seattle and I

3
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:30,976
Started talking to her about how I would approach

4
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:35,072
The idea of writing a song about a constitutional amendment

5
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,168
We started talking about some different amendments and then

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,824
Started focusing on the 4th amendment

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,176
I thought of doing some research and I ended up finding

8
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:53,248
A legal term associated with the Fourth Amendment

9
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,064
Poem fruit of the poisonous tree

10
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,936
I named my son after

11
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:18,336
It means that evidence found by being searched illegally is being tainted evidence

12
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,384
Cannot be used against someone in court

13
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:27,040
I had a realization that the fourth amendment is basically about having consent in the way

14
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:33,440
Play retreated by the government and so my song references that by way of romantic consent

15
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:39,840
At the parallel

16
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:18,240
The first lyrics I wrote for the song where when you take

17
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:24,640
Take what you took for me

18
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:49,728
That was Briana marela with her song fruit of the poisonous tree

19
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,264
Inspired by the Fourth Amendment

20
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,056
Got to say it's one of my favorites

21
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,616
Jad abumrad this is more perfect

00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,408

It's a story about how the Constitution is supposed to fit

00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,479
People when they come face-to-face with

77
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247

Required

00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,415
Nor excessive fines imposed

93

No cruel and unusual punishment

94
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,047
It's a seamless

95
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
Story

96
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
Humble law enforcement

97
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
And the creation of

98
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
Protection

99
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,959
Edith

100
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
Stage in the process

101
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,823
So you can investigate without a probable cause in a warrant

102
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,919
You can interrogate by making somebody's incriminate themselves

103

You can't eat judicate without giving somebody

104

Due process and a lawyer

105
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,063
I know you can't punish

106
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
Anyway that's cruel and unusual

107
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
No other

108
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
Bill of Rights

109
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
Anywhere

110
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
How's this

111
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
Kind of

112
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,279
Organized and thoughtfully

113
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
Developed

114
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,839
Set of protection

115
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
But

116
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,679
We know that

117
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
So often

118
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
These amendments

119
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
Work the way that they

120
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
They're supposed to

121
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,479

Seeing all of these police officers around

149

192
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,591
Double Jeopardy self-incrimination due process taking

193
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:56,223
V is designed to protect you when the cop has you in custody and is asking you a question

194
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:02,879
V is the one that gives you

195
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:12,095
Did they like read you your rights and whatever that you have the right to remain silent and all that

196
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:17,727
I didn't get my Miranda rights read to me until I left

197
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
Interrogation

198
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,335
At some point that evening when they're at the station

199
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,407
Decapitated me see a lady is going to come identify

200
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
Christopher is

201
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:33,855
Take into this room and handcuffed to a bench next to this big window

202
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
In a while

203
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,719
The lady straight up to the window

204
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,535
And pointed at me and me and the lady Casita

205
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,631
In an police officer say this is the guy that killed your husband

206
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
Mia I could

207
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
.

208
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
But I read her lips

209
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
She said yeah

210
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
Bitched him

211
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,103
And I'm like now I know

212
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,407
She didn't just say what I thought you say

213
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
And I go back in there

214
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
I'm not looking

215
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,295
Whatever y'all saying I did I didn't do

216
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
And they say we are you know what Miss Scott

217
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
Retired me a sandwich

218
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,487
You're going to be charged with capital murder

219
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,279
Acetabulum murder

220
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,583
I say survey I ain't killed nobody

221
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
So I go in the restroom

222
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:24,799
I can't cry because I'm so scared tears won't even come out my eyes I'd literally

223
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,871
Pace myself is probably hard as I ever could

224
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,151
And it heard it

225
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,711
So right then I said is real

226
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
6th

227
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:37,855
The sixth seventh amendment in the seventh are designed to protect you

228
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,439
When they decided to charge you it all criminal prosecution

229
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,487
The accused shall enjoy the right

230
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
Speedy and public trial

231
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:49,375
Define impartial jury and to have the assistance of counsel for his

232
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,935
Defense sixth amendment is for criminal cases

233
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
7th is for civil

234
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,055
But they both say that you get the right to a jury and a lawyer

235
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:02,175
I don't even know what capital murder meant what does that mean where your lawyer tell you

236
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,503
Christopher is appointed a lawyer

237
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,807
And that same day in his cell

238
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,647
I can tell by his body language that he feel like

239
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,183
I was actually guilty

240
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:18,559
He say but periodically I'm going to come and talk to you about the Reno the process in

241
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
Disney another

242
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,375
None of that never happened

243
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
Nunda never had

244
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,751
Christopher says he talked to the guy for maybe five

245
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,567
I didn't see him anymore

246
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,615
Until my travel

247
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
Enter from

248
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,479
Starting from that first conversation that you have with him

249
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
To all the way to the trial

250
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,575
How long were you in jail

251
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
Maybe

252
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
A couple of months

253
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,999
First day of the trial during jury

254
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,327
I'm sitting in there I'm dressed in my suit

255
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:57,727
You know I'm trying to look respectable and in trying to keep a you know a good face for my girlfriend cuz she's

256
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
Is there

257
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,591
Trying to show that I'm still strong even though I'm weak at this time

258
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639
The 6th Amendment

259
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,711
Guarantees you a trial by a jury of your peers

260
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,271
And what that means legally is

261
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Always a

262
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
But

263
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
The spirit of it

264
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,135
The spirit of that word

265
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
Pierce

266
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
Basically means that

267
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,487
The jury should represent

268
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
The group the people that

269
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
Live around you

270
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,423
Some point Christopher looks over to the jury box and he realizes that

271
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
Every black member

272
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Of the jury pool has been

273
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
I had a

274
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
All white G repair

275
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
And I saw this

276
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
I see it now

277
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
How did this happen

278
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,223
And I looked at my attorney

279
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
I see how

280
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,807
Did this happen

281
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,623
In the most technical sense

282
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,159
The 6th Amendment

283
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
He's present

284
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
But somehow

285
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,559
It still doesn't protect him in the back

286
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
4 hours

287
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,655
Call about 4 hours Captain America

288
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
He's bored

289
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,495
My deliberation nasty football

290
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
A 30-minute

291
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
That's it

292
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,383
So they come back in a judge as a juror parent panel

293
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,943
Have you came up with your decision

294
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,991
In a jury Foreman say yes

295
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,807
Your honor and indecision is guilty

296
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,879
Christmas card you are guilty of capital murder

297
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
Just like that

298
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
Years later

299
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
Christopher Scott

300
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
Would be

301
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
Cleared of all of these

302
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
Discharges

303
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
Unequivocally

304
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,239
So in that moment

305
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
These amendments

306
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
The fourth fifth

307
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
6 they let him down

308
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,407
But there is this

309
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
One moment

310
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,967
The trial where

311
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,503
You could argue that that

312
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,783
1 Amendment

313
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,343
Ever so faintly

314
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Rings

315
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
8th Amendment

316
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,231
The eighth says once they convicted you and I want to punish

317
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,535
How can I do it

318
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,583
Can they be cruel and unusual

319
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,887
And the Eighth Amendment bars cruel and unusual

320
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,727
The only thing that I appreciated the most

321
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,031
That my judge did for me

322
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
She asked me

323
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,407
Why should not seek the death penalty

324
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:18,271
In my own and words was I could you kill an innocent man

325
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
In this moment it almost feels like

326
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,511
The spirit of the eighth amendment is

327
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
What changes Krista

328
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,839
She said mister Scott

329
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,399
You just saved your own life today

330
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:39,007
We're not going to kill you but we're going to give you a capital life sentence

331
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,799
And I almost think

332
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Because

333
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:48,991
Although he was about to go to prison for a crime that he didn't commit

334
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
He says that

335
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,807
This sentence

336
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,135
It feels like Mercy

337
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Because I'm like

338
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:00,255
Where you not going to kill me that mean I can fight for my freedom again

339
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:20,735
Christopher Scott spent 12 years in prison

340
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,039
For being exonerated in 2009

341
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,575
After someone else

342
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,367
Confessed to the crime

343
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:30,463
He sent founded an organization called House of renewed hope

344
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,559
Which tries to help exonerate others you've been wrongfully convicted

345
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:40,191
In the story of the events of that night there are some places where Christopher Scott's account in the Dallas

346
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
Police Department

347
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
Differ

348
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,055
What was presented here is largely based on Christopher's

349
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
Experiences he tells it

350
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,151
When we reached out to the Dallas PD for comment

351
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
They did not offer a spa

352
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,023
Will be back in a minute

353
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
It is more perfect

354
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,599
We put together

355
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
The album songs

356
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,951
For the season based on the 27 amendments to the US Constitution

357
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
Constitution

358
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,999
Sarkari

359
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
Just brought you some liner notes

360
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
From a memo

361
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
4 to 8

362
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,607
And we started off the Epic

363
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
Wisdom

364
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
4th amendment

365
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
Next song

366
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
From Briana marela

367
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,775
But that leaves songs five through eight we haven't talked about this yet

368
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
We haven't heard from someone

369
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
I heard that one

370
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,527
Starting with this woman I'm McKenzie

371
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
And I play music

372
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
Under the name Torres

373
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,135
Oh and what amendment

374
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,439
Did you choose to write about I wrote about V

375
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
5th Amendment

376
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,023
Grand jury double jeopardy

377
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,815
Self-incrimination due process

378
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,911
Peking so the Fifth Amendment as I understand it that's the one that protects

379
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
The person from

380
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,007
From no person shall be subject for the same offense

381
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:24,127
Be twice put in Jeopardy of life or limb and from self-incrimination

382
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,967
But the last part nor shall private property be taken for public use

383
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
Love just come

384
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:33,343
Is this the one that I have chose to focus on for the song

385
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
Peking

386
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
That last part of the Fifth Amendment is

387
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,863
Often referred to by just that were taking

388
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,423
It's what you always hear being debated

389
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
When the government

390
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
Decides

391
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,287
Seize private property for public good

392
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
Park

393
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
War

394
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,639
More controversially for a highway

395
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,943
Mackenzie chose to write about

396
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
This part

397
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:06,879
Connecting it to the story of Dred Scott

398
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:12,415
Call

399
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,871
That was Torres with the song about the Fifth Amendment

400
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,895
Monday the 6th

401
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,711
Which comes from a band headed by a guy

402
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
You may recognize

403
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:40,319
New movies this is Ezra Miller from Sons of an illustrious father

404
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,159
Picture of the sixth amendment Sixth Amendment

405
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,207
Right to speedy trial by jury

406
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Witnesses

407
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
Cancel

408
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:53,375
Because I think reading through them we recognize both its importance and

409
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:59,775
How rarely in our times it was observed or adhered to

410
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:12,575
We use various examples in the song

411
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,159
From current events

412
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,464
To illustrate and demonstrate

413
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,000
That this

414
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,048
Like many of the other amendments

415
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:29,216
Has lost its meaning and application must come

416
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:54,816
In Chicago

417
00:21:55,072 --> 00:22:01,216
Square

418
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:11,712
That's an excerpt from the 6th amendment song from Ezra Miller and Sons of an illustrious

419
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
Father Brown

420
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
Trio

421
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
Onto the 7th

422
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:15,808
Hello

423
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,880
This is Steve Hilton from Nana grizol

424
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,464
I was excited to write a song about the 7th Amendment 7th Amendment

425
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,768
Jury trial in civil lawsuit

426
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,656
Because even though it's a part of the Bill of Rights very few people know what it does

427
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,824
I can see this time using an analytical frame known as racial capitalism

428
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,624
Atlanta, Georgia

429
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,024
What are rights

430
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,416
Amendment song from Nana grizol

431
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,488
Band based in Athens Georgia

432
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,280
That included a couple members of

433
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,304
Great experimental Rock

434
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
Band

435
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,096
From my area

436
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,632
Neutral Milk Hotel

437
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
Eminem

438
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:39,008
For the Eighth Amendment we got a song from the local NYC surf rock band name

439
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
Wasted

440
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:46,688
Who were once apparently named the best party Band by GQ Magazine a here is frontwoman

441
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:51,808
Jessica Lewis died I set it up to write a song about the 8th Amendment

442
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Because

443
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,160
I thought it's just so obviously already sounded like song lyrics

444
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,536
Excessive bail shall not require words that define disposed

445
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
Nor cruel and unusual punishments

446
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,552
High-waisted steak on the 8th

447
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,880
Rings out of the two most debated words

448
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,952
Usual is worth

449
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
Contain a lot

450
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:35,840
Stop the idea of Mercy tucked in there the idea of what is just

451
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
Punishment

452
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
Something there

453
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,192
We the people are supposed to be protected from punishment

454
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,752
That are cruel and unusual but those words

455
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
What is cool

456
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,848
What is a usual

457
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,920
What if a punishment is cruel but not unusual

458
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,224
Are we protected from that

459
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,856
These are the kind of questions people ask

460
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,136
About The Jacka

461
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
Which is what

462
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,696
Jessica says the band was

463
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,512
Thinking about when they wrote the song over 17000

464
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
People have an X

465
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
Cuted

466
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
Bolin death row

467
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,656
And 32 states still have the death penalty

468
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,960
Which is why I am just

469
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,032
My mind is boggled with the idea that these inmates

470
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
The last bit of freedom

471
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,872
Is the freedom to choose how they're going to die

472
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
And I

473
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:25,504
Can't imagine being the captain of your own soul and being forced to decide

474
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:29,856
Tire going to travel into the next world

475
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,744
I wanted the song to have

476
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,144
Eerie haunting creepy

477
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,032
Stick with you by like a siren song luring you into the field Melody

478
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,360
And then building to this redoubt the realization that

479
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:57,760
Did this amendment is so important hitting and involves so many people that have two

480
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
30

481
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,576
Weight and burden of death

482
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:06,976
I think that's why I was most drawn to the 8th Amendment and why this song

483
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:12,352
Kind of a little bit different sound for me and for my band high waisted

484
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,680
Usually tend to write in the normal pop and this

485
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:20,544
Song lured me into writing this sort of

486
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,944
Text Jim

487
