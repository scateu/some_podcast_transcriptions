Cake on jeroboam Rod this is more perfect

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,064
United States we gave the Supreme Court the power to find Justice for people

Sometimes even be on national board with Swiss

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,312
Question is how far we want to go

11
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,408
Should our Supreme Court

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
Did the Supreme Court of the world

13
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,624
Supreme Court of the United States

14
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:12,448
Supreme Court of the United States

15
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,800
United States

16
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,608
Okay so I grew up at a time

17
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:45,216
When a lot of people genuinely saw America differently than they do now

18
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,544
This is the 70s and 80s Carter Reagan years

19
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
There's a sense

20
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,384
If you are new arrivals

21
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,920
America was special

22
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Exceptional

23
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,016
We held the world to a higher standard

24
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,624
Certainly brought my family to America

25
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,280
Okay so it's not that way anymore so much and it seems like everyday at least in my lifetime we're asking the question

26
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,328
How should we feel

27
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,376
About that

28
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:20,288
What was that is that higher calling that's somehow For Better or Worse embedded in the idea of being American is

29
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:26,688
That stupidly wrongheaded and arrogant or is there something in that that we still

30
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,224
Still should embrace

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,344
That argument is happening has been happening and

32
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,648
Totally fascinating way at the Supreme Court

33
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,928

About Who We Are

37
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328

42
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:56,384
I believe you are now kp-1 okay I am now

45
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:11,232
The Story begins appropriately enough not in America but it starts in 1976 with

46
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,280
This woman I have to

47
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
Get used to

48
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,632
Yeah

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,240
Okay so I guess the first thing if you could just introduce yourself why

50
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,800
My name is Dolly filartiga

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,688
I am from Hawaii

52
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,760
Paraguay it's a small country right on top of Argentina

53
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
Andales family the Florida coast

54
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,440
Pretty big deal over there

55
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,512
You my family was that my grandfather was

56
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Very

57
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,560
Fridge

58
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:52,960
The Florida keys made their money exporting tobacco to Europe for big cigarette companies like

59
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,520
Datong

60
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,824
Lost a family that owns it

61
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,384
Beautiful flower in the countryside

62
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,432
Lots of land

63
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
Do airplanes

64
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,320
Now this could have been dollies

65
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,160
But you will say I'm going to win

66
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
And it wasn't

67
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,976
Because of her father

68
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,280
Your father what's his name

69
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:22,143
I want coin coin and what what did your dad do for a living

70
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,983
Her dad very famously turned his back on his fancy upbringing

71
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:30,079
The entire family to the countryside

72
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,663
And there he set up a clinic to give Medical Care to the poor indigenous

73
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,015
Farmers in that area 47000 people

74
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:44,415
He was the only doctor in a lot of cities that became kind of like a patron saint of the countryside

75
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:51,071
Not only would give the medical treatment but when they came in he would tell them go vote rise above your station

76
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,887
And as you can imagine as word got out

77
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
This really pissed off

78
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
Paraguay's ruler at the time

79
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,567
A guy named alfredo stroessner

80
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:07,967
He was called the pulpo the octopus because it said he had arms and tentacles that reach into everybody's

81
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
Live there in the country

82
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:14,367
Hatsune Horst American history here at Appalachian State University

83
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,927
Wadali was growing up Renee live

84
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:23,327
Next door in Formosa Argentina

85
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
Paraguay

86
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,911
What part of this like big network of dictators

87
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,751
All across Latin America and it was called Operation Condor

88
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,287
Operation Condor

89
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:37,407
Was a network that link together military dictatorships of Latin America so

90
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,455
Brazil Argentina Chile

91
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:43,551
Bolivia Uruguay Paraguay

92
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,623
Renee said the Operation Condor was a lot like a spider web

93
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,695
With Pinochet at the master Weavers

94
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
Spider

95
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,815
The Communist Revolution in Cuba had just happened and so these six

96
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,863
Super militaristic dictatorships

97
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:02,239
They banded together to pretty much trap communism in Cuba out of South America

98
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,359
Remember this is a cold war in America really wanted to keep communism out of the continent to

99
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,151
So it's really likely that the

100
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,175
The CIA was involved

101
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,271
The result was a network of state-sponsored Terror

102
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
In the Darkness

103
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,111
Part of the night they will come to your apartment and

104
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:22,207
Dragon stuff you in the trunk of a Ford Falcon car

105
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
And you disappear forever

106
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,423
My father used to tell depressed

107
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
Vote for the strut nut

108
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,823
Contacts behind Dr filart against Rebellion

109
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,943
Kelly said he travel all over the world giving talks trying to show everything what is drawing a rose

110
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
Doing in the car

111
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,039
Who tells patients when the government comes to buy your crops

112
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,575
14 day weather on sale

113
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
Don't give him a thing

114
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,047
Sally tried her best to ignore all this

115
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,375
We didn't get that long with my father I have to say that

116
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
So

117
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:08,031
When I get older she moved away from the country

118
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
I came to the city

119
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
To live

120
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
What city was

121
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Asuncion

122
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
She worked to put herself through school

123
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,991
And then what are Ethan and Alex

124
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
Follow me

125
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,343
And then Dolly says she work to put her two siblings do school

126
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,487
Her sister Anna Lee at the time was 14 and her brother julito was 17

127
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
Dockweiler

128
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,071
He was her favorite

129
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,119
Polito look like my mother

130
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143

Crust on him

134
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,335
This is Dolly's daughter Paloma

135
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
Very handsome

136
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,663
Yes but he wasn't a player

137
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,735
And what was what was hoagitos personality like

138
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
Was he loud

139
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Was he quiet

140
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
You see those people that

141
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,879
See things and you left because you

142
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,671

Types of YouTube

146

Redis

147
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,215
That's the backdrop 1976

148
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
Sally's in the city with her two siblings

149
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,591
Why Dad's on the country drumming up opposition to the regime

150
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,127
At that time

151
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,407
Accordingly.

152
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,759
She said many friends that he feel like he was being followed

153
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,319
He didn't want to tell ask because

154
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,623
We are we still teaching to be careful

155
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:30,719
Even my father who are you to tell him be careful because you are

156
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
Why my son is

157
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,351
And at that time in Paraguay it was well known that there was spies

158
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
Everywhere

159
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
They put away

160
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
Without what

161
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,007
Send expression in one tiny person with hairy feet

162
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,543
Scolipede eyewear

163
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,359
It's a nickname for informers of the regime

164
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
So things are already tense

165
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
And then

166
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,759
On March 29th 1976

167
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,575
Dolly and her siblings are turning in for the night

168
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
Around 11

169
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,927
Telangana Libra sleep in one bed

170
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,463
Incognito has kids room

And so he went to rescue Steve and then when I go 9

172
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,887

She didn't know him too well but he was a policeman and she always had suspicions about him so.

180
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,359
Only steps out and it's a chilly night in her nightgown

181
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383

184
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:11,839
35 + 35

185
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:16,447
She says she walked down the hall the policeman sort of parted for her

186
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,311
And guided her to a room in the back of the house

187
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,639
A winning to that room open that door

188
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,455
Insolito Spa

189
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783

Anna mattress

191
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,575
And this

192
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,415
Human being my brother was so

193
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
Beautiful

194
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
His body is

195
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,815
Converting gas as you can see where

196
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
Recent stabbing

197
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,375
Over and over again and

198
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
Maybe tied up

199
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,751

200
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
Fitbit densities

201
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
This

202
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,639
There was an electrical wire attached to his genitals

203
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
Boss trucks

204
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:10,463
Juju chiusano how to spray how how other human being can do that to another one

205
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,279
Monica never done anything to YouTube.

206
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
I don't know

207
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,679
Dolly said she bolted out of the room and immediately ran into Inspector General Pena

208
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
He was standing in the doorway

209
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,543
ISO Pena in my way

210
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
Autonomy

211
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,615
You better shut up

212
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,407
The thing that uses

213
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
Surf

214
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,295
And you better keep quiet because next time we'll be you something

215
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
He told you next time it would be you

216
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
And your family

217
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
You better shut up

218
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,791
I say I am. You feel ad

219
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,375
You don't know who I am.

220
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,239
Don't make me shut up today but tomorrow in Valley with no

221
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,775
My duty to my brother

222
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,919
Over the next three years the family tried to get Justice

223
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,223
They suit Pena in the paraguayan courts

224
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,783
But the lawyers were threatened when was disbarred

225
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,135
When Dolly and her mom testified against Pena the same as twitches

226
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,415
So we went to jail

227
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,487
When Dolly and her mom got out of jail they race Wilson

228
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:19,839
Showing what they did to my brother taken dance reporter through newspaper articles

229
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,631
The coffin investigation

230
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,679
Before anything could happen

231
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Pena

232
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
She disappeared

233
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
Havana

234
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
The country altogether

235
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
The question is

236
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
If you're Dolly what are you do

237
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,015
Your brother has just been brutally murdered

238
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,551
You know who did it

239
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:44,671
But you know you can't get Justice in Paraguay because the whole court systems in with the regime

240
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,975
And you can't go to the international criminal court

241
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
Because it doesn't exist yet

242
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,791
And even if it did exist

243
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
Your case is way too small

244
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
So what do you do

245
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,167
When I said we have to decide

246
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
Fast forward to 1979

247
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
I moved

248
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:04,895
The Washington Dallas living in DC jeannene cooking any houses working part time at a law firm

All this time she's had feelers out with her dad's connections ngos

250
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,391
Just trying to find out at least we're paying is living in there

251
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
Finally

252
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
One day that's bring

253
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,511
She got a phone call from one of those connections

254
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
Babe

255
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,815
Found pinyin

256
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
They told me that opinion

257
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
What's leaving kid in Brooklyn

258
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:31,007
She's been working at a furniture store in Brooklyn when a fellow paraguayan had recognized him

259
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
Outed him

260
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,871
I didn't know what I was going to do but I want to chastise

261
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:41,503
Deep ditches in this case I was desperately

262
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,623
Got a pair of gland responsible for the death of another paraguayan in Paraguay

263
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:53,023
What's happening firewise like even if he did something wrong and I Y

264
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
Which it seems like he did

265
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,655
There's no pictures of nothing to do with America

266
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,983
When I said we have to decide

267
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
So

268
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,055
I was looking for help

269
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,639
Daily contacts a lawyer who gets her in touch with this guy

270
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:14,783
Peter Weiss Center for constitutional rights

271
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,343
Peter says even before dali showed up

272
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:22,975
We were trying to figure out how to sue people committing crimes against humanity and war crimes

273
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:30,143
For example 504 unarmed Vietnamese women children and old men were massacred overall

274
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,519
4 Hour. By US troops this was around the time of the me Lai massacre in central Vietnam

275
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:42,431
When that happened my colleagues at the center and I was there a way for them

276
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:47,551
U.s. military on behalf of one of the victims crime was committed

277
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
Abroad

278
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,647
So I came and met Peter

279
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:57,791
And password head so I called an emergency meeting of the Santa stuff

280
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:04,447
Is there a way we can help is there some like wormhole in American law that would let us bring non

281
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,775
Can Americans and non American crimes into American courts

282
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:12,127
And one of us at the Sony was obviously a good researcher

283
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:16,479
And I said hey you know there's a super old super obscure law

284
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
Something called the alien tort statute

285
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:26,207
Alien tort statute

286
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231

And a nobleman by birth

By the way some people didn't like it

330
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,463
Thomas Jefferson said

Why you say that

337
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,191
Doesn't matter what's important is that he is here

338
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,751
America has a bad reputation and

339
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
End up meeting this

340
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543

A nice young Quaker girl

342
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
A quote

343
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Eros

344
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,199

00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,319
Very much so

349
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:34,207
And so it started circulating rumors around town around Philadelphia

350
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,487
That long time

351
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
Was a liar

352
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:40,095
That he was not of noble birth and wasn't even enough

353
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,655
Probably gold digger

354
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191

00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
Stormed over to the

358
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,919
French Embassy

359
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
Freaky ghost

Barb marwat

364
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
Who was the embassy

365
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
Here's an aside

366
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,791
Marwat later was Napoleon's Menace

367
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559

369
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703

370
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,495
When is barbed wire is like

371
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775

But you know the other friends

373
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
The long-term stuff

374
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
Maybe Skylander guy walks in

375
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,783
I guess he doesn't show a lot of respect he's like you know any drop everything and help me out with the situation cuz people are spreading rumors

376
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,111
You're saying I'm not a nobleman or whatever I need you to stand up for me

377
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,903
And marbois refused

378
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
We don't know why

379
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,999
At any rate in response

380
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,559
Longchamp shouted at marbois

381
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
Google Translate

382
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,143
I will dishonor you

383
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,959
And then he called him

384
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,751
And this is a transgression

385
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,543
A laughable scam

386
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,359
Which is kind of

387
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:00,223
Can you imagine people calling someone that laughable scam today

388
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,575
It seems tame honestly very day

389
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
But those words

390
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
Would create a

391
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,671
National

392
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:14,047
Crisis everything were talking about today

393
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,327
Goes back to this

394
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,119
Little confrontation

395
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:22,239
How what do you mean by Connor was as big deal.

396
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:27,359
Hamilton dies right something like always gonna laughable Scamp food cause

397
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:31,455
You don't even like that's the kind of thing you do a duel over it was an indignity

398
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:35,807
Where boil was so pissed at the moment and he did the right thing in that time. Which is

399
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:42,463
Still have a duel with the man contacted his bosses he wrote a letter across the seas to France and instead

400
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
Y'all

401
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,559
Will you do about this now the French

402
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,143
Don't like what's going on the French

403
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
Want us to

404
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
To put him on a ship back to

405
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
France

406
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,751
And have France

407
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,543
Punish the long time

408
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
And the

409
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,383
Pennsylvania executive Council

410
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
Agreed

411
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,199
But the judges refused

412
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
That's ridiculous

413
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
All that

414
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,063
Causes France to say

415
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
You know what

416
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,903
Be sure that America's

417
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,207
Take care of this they're going to punish this guy

418
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,023
Maybe we can't take this brand new country seriously

419
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,071
Give me some land of no law

420
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:28,287
Huge thing and you got to keep in mind at that time United States was a third world nation

421
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,895
We were weak France had been our buddy during the revolution

422
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,175
And the feeling was

423
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,759
We desperately needed the help of other countries

424
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:44,159
Because it reduces baby little country by the way the Dutch Ambassador was Furious to because he said

425
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
If you don't

426
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,719
Punished long jobs

427
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,255
I'm leaving the state

428
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,047
He actually threatened to leave

429
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
State

430
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,351
It really created

431
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
Problems

432
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,911
So we had to do some

433
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,959
But the question was

434
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,007
What the national government

435
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,567
Had no Authority whatsoever

436
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,615
To deal with or punish

437
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,895
A person like lingerie

438
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,735
Because it wasn't a crime to just say I will dishonor you

439
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,271
And even if it were

440
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:14,367
The incident happened at what was essentially the French Embassy

441
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,647
Samovar you

442
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
That that made it

443
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,744
This is a situation outside of the United

444
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,072
States so I step in there and I'm also the only under the rules

445
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,864
Yeah that's the argue

446
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,424
YouTube did we have jurisdiction over that space

447
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,520
My point is that the new US Government they were just powerless

448
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
I didn't know what to do

449
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,080
What happened

450
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,872
Well the case goes to court

451
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,456
And the judge in that case

452
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
Figure out what to do

453
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,016
Really badly

454
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,832
Got to punch this guy and he's looking at this book

455
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,136
No law is that no laws

456
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
Skype

457
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
You don't

458
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,488
There are some

459
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:56,352
Start explicitly written down but that all people across the world

460
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Agree

461
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
Homemade

462
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,448
The Greeks that this is bad

463
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
Entente

464
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
The classic

465
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,128
Pirates

466
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,664
The Pirates are out there on the open

467
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,200
Pillaging

468
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,224
Plundering

469
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,992
Killing

470
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:17,856
And they are not really subject to anyone nation's laws they're not doing this in a nation

471
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,648
No one had specific jurisdiction over

472
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,208
Doing all the way back to Roman times

473
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,024
Pirates were designated as universal enemy

474
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
The hostess houmani

475
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
Generous

476
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,888
That's a male mowing history professor at Yale University

477
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,424
The phrase in Latin

478
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,216
Hostess houmani

479
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
The enemy of

480
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
And it means that

481
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,128
That may be there

482
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
Things that are

483
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
Zohan

484
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
You don't have to

485
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
Ocelot

486
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
And you don't have

487
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
Howard

488
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
Stop

489
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
The perpetrator

490
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
They're just so bad and

491
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
Piracy

492
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
Okay

493
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,608
So what the judge do

494
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Decides

495
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,680
This french guy in Philadelphia

496
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,240
Insults the fancy French guy in

497
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,032
The way that

498
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,056
We're going to solve this is

499
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
By saying that

500
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,104
The insulter

501
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,640
He's a little bit like a pirate

502
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,712
Now you just need to turn Pirates but it's the same concept

503
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,760
He said that that guy the long jump

504
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,320
Has broken international law

505
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,624
He is guilty of

506
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,416
An atrocious violation of

507
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
The law of nature

508
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,488
He not only France The Sovereign he represents

509
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
Also hurts

510
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,048
The common safety welding 1/8

511
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,096
He is guilty of a crime against

512
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,400
Whole world that's a quote from the ruler

513
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,680
They then

514
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
Finding

515
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,472
100 French

516
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
Crowns

517
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,520
And two years

518
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
2 years

519
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
2 years

520
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,592
For sale

521
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,896
I will dishonor you

522
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
Wow

523
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,504
This move by the judge basically works

524
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,064
Marble in France field good

525
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
There on Earth

526
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,928
Protected the Dutch Ambassador doesn't leave he stays but more importantly

527
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
Our story

528
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,280
In 79 Congress passed some of their very first laws

529
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,816
There's like this one big Bill about

530
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,608
Courts and in there

531
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,168
Is this thing called the alien tort

532
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
Statute

533
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
The only force that shoot

534
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:14,336
You know it was written into law to deal with this kind of situation

535
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
You are a diplomat

536
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,384
Insulted

537
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:21,504
But more generally it was meant to connect us law

538
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,272
To internet

539
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:27,136
Simplifying with a bunch but it basically says like

540
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,952
Somebody violates International norms

541
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,976
You know like a

542
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,768
Crime against the whole world

543
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,816
They can be sued in US Civil Court

544
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,376
But you're saying there's a law

545
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,192
From the beginning that allows and non us

546
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,752
Sue each other for non us crime

547
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
In US courts

548
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Yeah

549
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,336
So weird

550
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:51,200
But like the thing is this is this is Kelli again when it comes to this law

551
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,992
Forever no one actually used it

552
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,320
It was barely mentioned for 200 years

553
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,600
Why

554
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,880
Why wouldn't it come up

555
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,440
If you think about it kind of makes sense it wasn't used

556
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,208
Because

557
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,352
It was a super specific LOL this is a weird circumstance in which we really needed to bring international law

558
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,144
And use it inside our borders

559
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,936
But that kind of thing like

560
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,960
Diplomatic

561
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,520
Bite that didn't happen very often

562
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
And more generally

563
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,872
The prevailing idea at the time was that

564
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
Internationally we should

565
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,992
Kind of Stan are laying like if you're going to come into our country

566
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,832
And that's what are citizens of gal we're going to do something about that but

567
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,904
If you want to do something to your own citizens

568
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
That's not my business

569
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:40,352
There's an old idea that in every country The Government Can

570
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:46,752
Due to its people whatever it wants and a nobody in any foreign country no foreign government has any biz

571
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,032
Business telling them what to do

572
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,616
This is Eric Posner the University of

573
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,688
The reason that the alien tort statute was

574
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,272
Pretty much ignored is because of this idea

575
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:04,928
That we're not going to tell you what to do in your borders so don't you come into our country and tell us what to do

576
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,768
Don't know this but there was actually a humanitarian basis for this

577
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,304
Harsh sounding princip

578
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,864
Came about in the 17th century

579
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:17,216
The problem back in the 17th century were religious wars

580
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:23,360
Protestants and Catholics Catholics and the Protestants endless strife and so the idea was

581
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,152
Let's simplify things

582
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:31,552
And just understand that in foreign countries people have different values and ideas and it just not

583
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,088
Decorah good in the long run if

584
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,112
If we try to

585
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,672
Tell people in foreign countries how they should behave

586
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,720
And this was the dominant

587
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
View

588
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
Hundreds of years

589
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,072
Until World War II really

590
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,448
But the Hulk has changed everything

591
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:53,056
At one of the defenses that Nazis

592
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:59,456
Gave to the specific charge of massacring Jews is that they're protected by the principal siren

593
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:06,112
That was you know considered unacceptable argument and countries around the world basically agreed

594
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,928
That limits had to be put on sovereignty

595
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,488
And those limits would be known as human rights

596
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:20,192
And a few years later in 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights

597
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,872
On which they are organized in suddenly

598
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,200
All eyes turn to human rights

599
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,736
Professor Samuel mine again

600
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,784
He says if you fast-forward to the 70s

601
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,344
Americans having fought Vietnam

602
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,160
Having solid themselves and doing so

603
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,000
Want to bring human rights to the world now

604
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:53,216
And the human rights movement was very exciting you know there were rock concerts in

605
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:59,616
You know it's Joan Baez and a lot

606
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,664
You know rock stars on

607
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:08,064
Pop culture icons get involved the Peace Prize

608
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,112
Price for 1977

609
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,648
As long

610
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,672
Is I am present

611
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:19,072
Jimmy Carter's inviting the government of the United States dissidents from Eastern Europe to visit the White House

612
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,144
Continue throughout the world to enhance human rights

613
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,544
It's it's a little new car that's very exciting to a lot of people and and rightly

614
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
Queso

615
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,664
It would be great if America could make the world a better place

616
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:49,536
So this brings us back to dali

617
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,072
I commandment

618
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,144
Peter and Peter Weiss

619
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,496
Trying to figure out how to bring dollies case to us courts that's the contacts

620
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,312
America is having this moment with human rights

621
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,872
Wanna bring it to the rest of the world

622
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:10,528
Someone someone in Peter's office to just using this old little law to get Justice for Dolly it seems obvious like

623
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,856
Course so I called an emergency meeting of the Santa stuff

624
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,416
Basically the idea was that

625
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,464
Some crimes

626
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
Like piracy

627
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,792
Was so bad that

628
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,096
Pet boarders didn't matter

629
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:30,752
Like anyone should be able to prosecute them and the US should be able to bring these people to court on behalf of the world

630
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:34,336
But I have to tell you that the majority of

631
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,128
Calling Samsung

632
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:42,528
We were slightly insane did your boss say like

633
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:47,648
It's all about Paraguay

634
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,976
Eventually just case gets in front of the federal circuit court

635
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,048
Does the federal court eastern district Brooklyn

636
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:57,376
And the day of the trial you stop hanging in the elevator at corn

637
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
Yes

638
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,704
I met him in the elevator

639
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
And I asked him

640
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,056
Why you do that to my brother

641
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,360
Why did you do that to him

642
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:08,896
Why

643
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,480
Equivalent answer sheet what shape

644
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
Anyway

645
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,368
Lemon decor

646
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,184
Keisha butter Waianae answering so what

647
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,744
Anacortes admitted autopsy reports

648
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,304
We went in there photography

649
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,864
Photography pictures

650
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,448
We've bring picture of him with the mattress

651
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:37,312
Alita was in the mattress time defeat in the hands ladies

652
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:43,712
Computer says that after he made his argument an interesting thing happened

653
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
The judge

654
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,040
Started to go back to his Chambers and

655
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
Before he got

656
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,112
Out of the country turn around

657
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,208
Interesting

658
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
Pancakes

659
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,024
So what happened

660
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,816
Well

661
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,120
The judge ruled against them

662
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,704
But they appeal to the second circuit

663
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,984
And ultimately

664
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:10,848
A judge orders Kenya to pay 10 million dollars to Dolly and her family

665
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,640
What they want

666
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:19,040
Yeah what happened was like a miracle

667
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,880
I was able to get Justice in United States

668
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,416
In the Florida case

669
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:30,816
They convinced the second circuit that the alien tort statute

670
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
Quest for human rights

671
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:39,520
They say look I'm torture is now like piracy

672
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:45,920
That's all an explosion of cases that mean in 1984

673
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:52,320
Granby Libyan Arab Republic and peace out

674
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:58,720
There was a case from Argentina called for TV Suarez Mason 1991

675
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:05,120
Guatemala 1993 Ecuador and Peru and 295 former Yugoslavia in 1999

676
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:22,272
Basically what you saw in the eighties and nineties and into the early 2000s is the cases from

677
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,320
All over the world started just like

678
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,112
Flooding into American Court

679
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:30,464
The reason this statute is so important is it at its American law

680
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:34,560
It gives American lawyers who want to use their legal training

681
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,352
Something to do with part of this

682
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,168
Lawyers can save the world

683
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
Wow

684
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:44,800
Practicing law looking at the role of the 80s

685
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:48,384
It's hard to underestimate just how much impacted

686
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:55,552
This is Katherine Gallagher also from the center for constitutional rights

687
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,368
35 years has become the source

688
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:02,464
Almost all significant human rights litigation

689
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,536
In the United States and indeed in the world

690
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,072
And that's John Bellinger

691
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,352
Legal advisor for the

692
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
Department of State

693
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,656
From 2005

694
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,680
2009

695
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,216
Before Florida cuz there

696
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,752
Was very little that

697
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,800
Victims of human rights violations

698
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
Could do

699
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,104
There were a lot of folks

700
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,504
Especially in the American legal system who felt like America had never been a greater force for good in the

701
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,040
World

702
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
But

703
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,720
The rest of the world

704
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,024
Wasn't so sure

705
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,008
That's coming up

706
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,800
More perfect will continue in a moment

707
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,000
This is more perfect I'm Jedi home run

708
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,072
Back to the 2K peas Kelsey Padgett and Kelly Prime

709
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
Here's Kelly

710
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:15,680
Where we left it a lot of good just happened we have an explosion of cases

711
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:19,008
American human rights lawyers are feeling really good about themselves

712
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,288
But

713
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,312
Diplomacy

714
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,128
Is a delicate thing many foreign government

715
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,712
Including many Western democracy

716
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:31,552
John Dellinger again Great Britain Australia Germany

717
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,576
Switzerland

718
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,624
Would regularly complain

719
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
Tumi

720
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:38,208
As the legal advice with the state department that

721
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,768
They thought that the alien tort statute

722
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,560
Was in fact itself

723
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,120
A violation of international law

724
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,400
Because

725
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,192
It allowed

726
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,472
Us judges

727
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,032
To have jurisdiction over

728
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,568
Directions to Tad's

729
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,360
Absolutely nothing to do

730
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,384
With United

731
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
Instead of dialing it back

732
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,248
Human rights lawyers decided

733
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,784
Why not push it

734
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,064
Even further

735
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,696
Surrounding 25

736
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:13,024
Give me the big leap they decided that instead of just going after

737
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,328
Individuals with foreign government officials

738
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:19,168
They were going to use this law to go after foreign corporations

739
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,032
When the first alien tort statute cases were filed against corporations

740
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,128
These cases were really seeing as

741
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,176
Is slightly crazy

742
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:34,272
How can you do this these are corporations these are not government

743
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,064
These are not dictators

744
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,368
How can you see them under this law

745
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,416
Human rights lawyer said was

746
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:45,280
It always keeps showed us that this law is about modern-day Pirates

747
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,352
What better example of pirates do we have nowadays

748
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,400
The multinational corporation

749
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,472
If you want to go all the way you could say

750
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,496
Babies big

751
00:35:54,752 --> 00:36:00,896
Massive entities that just can reach out the chemicals into any countries between jurisdiction move from one

752
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:05,760
The next to the next and brutal crimes like sometimes they Empower dictators

753
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
Sacramento crime

754
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,112
When you try and pin them down like when you want to hold them accountable

755
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,672
Banish

756
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,488
So yeah

757
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,512
All that sounds

758
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,048
Really

759
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:18,816
Abstract

760
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,632
For me it didn't really register like

761
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,424
Why you would go after a corporation

762
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,728
Until I heard this story

763
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,264
The story of cancer wewa

764
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:33,664
That even I grew up in a place with household in that my father was was a national figure because he was a right to know

765
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,200
Commentation newspapers

766
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,736
Just like Dolly can head this

767
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,016
Famously outspoken.

768
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,552
Social critic

769
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,600
Use a famous thorn in the side of the

770
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,136
The reason in this case

771
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,928
Military dictatorship

772
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,720
In Nigeria

773
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:53,120
New Year's Eve the military deposed the civilian democratically elected president

774
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,168
An 80s 90s Nigeria went through a

775
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,216
Series of military coups

776
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:03,872
And Kim's dad actually wrote this account that was like Fairy famous millions of people run

777
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:07,200
Country watched it

778
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,992
He would write articles about the

779
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:14,112
Andantino the subject of his birth is Collins and his television program

780
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:17,184
The inequalities of Nigeria political system

781
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,000
Situation of time Nigeria

782
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,792
Tons of oil under the grey

783
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,352
Estimated 30 billion dollars worth

784
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,168
Boil and in order for the military regime to get that

785
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
Out

786
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:33,312
They partnered with a division of shell companies in Nigeria as applying domestic gas

787
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,872
Generating electricity from was

788
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,456
The people who lived on the land where the oil was

789
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,248
They're really poor

790
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,064
Given

791
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,672
Barely any of this money against insult to injury

792
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,440
Uncheck

793
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:56,096
Oil production is creating an environmental disaster in our community

794
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,632
New Zealand

795
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
Is Loft

796
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,824
For the next Thousand Years father showing reporter ruin farmland

797
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,592
Q70

798
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,640
Oil still seeps to the surface

799
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,176
Nothing is going to grow here

800
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:16,576
You know that's it successful and has been devastated by all production in some places surface water contains

801
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,856
900 *

802
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,904
Accepted level of benzene

803
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:26,304
2 Kings dad you know he was writing articles about this he was speaking out about it

804
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,840
But eventually he decided

805
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,120
That was enough

806
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:34,752
And I need decided I think in the late 80s that he was going to take to the streets

807
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:43,200
Who lost the 1993 organized dogani day

808
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:45,760
For three hundred thousand people came out to protest

809
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,808
We are going to demand that right

810
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,160
Non violently

811
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,072
Over the next month

812
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:05,472
The protest keep going the escalated as tension increased I know it was badly beaten and then she'll

813
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:09,312
Too loud resulting in the closure of oil operations in the area

814
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,360
And they took millions of dollars with them

815
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,712
And the government depended almost solely on the revenues from

816
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,760
That's the one economic activity

817
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,784
And so

818
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,576
How long after the protest

819
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,624
Kim's dad was

820
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,648
Thrown into jail

821
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,440
And

822
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,792
Can junior he babykins frantically traveling the world trying to raise awareness of

823
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,816
Bad situation

824
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,352
Publicly put pressure on

825
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,912
On General abacha Nigeria head of state

826
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,216
November 10th 1995

827
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,520
2 years after his dad's been arrested

828
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:40,800
Annie's at the

829
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,592
International Conference New Zealand

830
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,616
Trying to

831
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,152
Wabi world leaders

832
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,968
And he says that after he just got this

833
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,760
Funny feeling

834
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,784
Walking across

835
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,344
One of the streets and I just saw the sun set

836
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
That evening

837
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,904
Beautiful sunset I see

838
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,696
Big Red

839
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
Sun

840
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,256
Just sinking into the bay

841
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,048
I'm dumb

842
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,728
Felt something go in my chest

843
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,544
And

844
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,848
I think I knew

845
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,224
I knew that something had happened

846
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:26,112
Cancel we were right in human Rights activist campaigner on behalf of his fellow tribesmen

847
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,672
Time this morning in the Nigerian prison

848
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,976
It says that world leaders spoke out

849
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,536
Prime Minister of England even Nelson Mandela

850
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,328
Unfortunate result to no avail

851
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,608
Nothing happened

852
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,424
Difficult to know what to do with all of that

853
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,568
How do you how do you get Justice full at what what happened to your father

854
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,128
You could argue

855
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
And

856
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,200
This is what lawyers later did ARG

857
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,784
But the only way to get Justice was not to go after the regime

858
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,064
What to do after

859
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,832
Show

860
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,648
And it's parent company Royal Dutch petroleum

861
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,440
In going after shell they claim that

862
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:04,000
Baby helps the Nigerian government do some

863
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,328
Horrendous things they claim that show aided and abetted the

864
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,608
Nigerian government

865
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,888
Kidnapping in

866
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:15,008
Torture and rely directly to the stuff or or jaded embedded so the claim is that they

867
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
Guns

868
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,568
Directions to buy guns

869
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,384
Well actually the allegation the claim is that

870
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,944
But still that's it that's not a

871
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:26,784
Rats that Cinderella things to like they claim that she'll wood

872
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,552
Call Lynn

873
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,880
Special Forces Unit of the Nigerian government that

874
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:37,536
Colloquy everybody was calling the kill and go mom go there claiming she was calling and hits yeah basically but she'll was like

875
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
Hand in hand with the governor

876
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,608
Of course she'll denies all this

877
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,400
And in 2002

878
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,168
People

879
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:43,936
I can

880
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,216
Put Moss Brothers

881
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
Lost family

882
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:51,104
You know and also surviving victims of all the Twilight State they banded together with some American lawyers

883
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,151
And brought a case under the island

884
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,455
They allege that she'll

885
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:59,039
Was essentially a hostess houmani generes

886
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,063
The enemy of

887
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,087
Of the human

888
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,111
Kind of race

889
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,647
And therefore

890
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,695
Could be tried in American courts

891
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,463
Yeah

892
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,511
And as you can imagine they got pushed back

893
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,535
In this case.

894
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,303
Challenged

895
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,351
All the way up to the Supreme Court

896
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:19,007
Ruger argument first this morning in case 10 1491 kiobel vs Royal Dutch petroleum

897
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:22,847
This case was actually argued twice but we're combining them here for Simplicity

898
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:26,431
So the basic issue in this case seems really simple at first

899
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,991
Can you use this law against Corporation

900
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:33,087
Like if you read the full article decisions

901
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,903
Like the pirate and slave trader before him

902
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,695
An enemy of all mankind

903
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:44,095
This is Justice Kagan actually reading from the Florida decision and saying you know we

904
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:48,191
The Court decide this is okay

905
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,727
The word today's Pirates

906
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:53,311
So the question was are corporations in that category

907
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,359
Baby considered today's Pirates

908
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,663
The principal issue before this court

909
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:00,735
Is whether a corporation can ever be held liable

910
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:07,135
For violating fundamental human rights Norms under the alien tort statute

911
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,415
Nigerians bringing the case

912
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:11,231
And it won't let me start by saying that

913
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:17,887
International human rights Norms that are at the basis that all the terrible crimes

914
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:23,775
All art agreed are crimes against humanity

915
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
My actions

916
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:31,711
They're not defined by whether the perpetrator is a human being or Corporation

917
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,015
Says that torture their today's Pirates

918
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,575
What about a group of torturous what about

919
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:42,975
Pirates Incorporated

920
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:52,447
What events led operation to buy

921
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:58,847
That's Justice Breyer basically agreeing that in this case to differentiate between like

922
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:05,503
A corporation doing bad things and a person doing bad things it's kind of silly

923
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
Air power play

924
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,831
The question is who are today's Pirates

925
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:12,671
He says Adolf Hitler was like a pirate

926
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:18,815
Who is there The Dread Pirates of our time

927
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:24,447
Billions for specialty Appliance of human rights cases from Florida on

928
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:30,847
Is part of a trend in the world today the trend in the world today is poured universe

929
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:36,223
Crystal Justice for people that nnn corporations that violate these kinds of

930
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:42,623
That's the trend in the United States has been the leader in our government is proclaimed our leadership position

931
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:49,023
We thought the argument went extremely well and we really did not see how

932
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,559
We should lose

933
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,583
But then

934
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,887
It was shells turn trouble is that

935
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,191
The choice to pursue corporations

936
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:59,775
Santiam on again the goose that laid the golden egg

937
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,311
Because on the one hand

938
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,359
It makes sense to shift

939
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,663
Two corporations they have the money

940
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,711
On the other hand corporations

941
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,247
Wolf use their money

942
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,551
To hire the best lawyers they can buy

943
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,087
Where is like

944
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:16,927
Kathleen Sullivan mr. chief justice and may it please the court

945
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:20,511
Kathleen Sullivan got up there she and the defense team basically

946
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,583
Sidestep the whole issue of whether corporations

947
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:28,447
Should or should not be considered Pirates whether this law should or should not be applied to corporations

948
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,983
They actually went

949
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
Bigger

950
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:37,151
They started talking about all the reasons why I actually use in the 80s for non-american crimes

951
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,943
I feel really bad idea

952
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,479
For anyone

953
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,039
I came down to three main points

954
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,063
1

955
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,623
Reciprocity

956
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:51,999
Battle United States Court

957
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:55,327
Anywhere in the world regardless of the place of the conduct

958
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,119
The other nations of the world 19

959
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:02,495
To do the same to us basically if we can take people from other countries and try them in our courts

960
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:09,151
What's stopping them from doing that to us

961
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:15,551
To the principal against International friction is at its highest

962
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:21,951
Nightmare you're basically saying other countries that you didn't elect win like them either frankly I didn't vote for them

963
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,999
You didn't vote for them they were appointed

964
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,791
And now

965
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:32,191
They're going to be patrolling international law are we really comfortable with that and I want to stress that

966
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,751
The point is that the u.s. is projecting here

967
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,311
Our law on to foreign countries

968
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,335
And finally

969
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,175
On the most

970
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,735
Basic level

971
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:49,343
What distance does the kids like that have in the course of the United States

972
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,159
How is any of our business

973
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:58,303
To the United States what's the weather at the point that really jive with Justice Alito

974
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,399
The United States has nothing to do

975
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,423
In a way

976
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,215
In that moment

977
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,031
He's captured how

978
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,055
America hits

979
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:09,823
Shifted

980
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:13,919
We didn't want to pretend to be that shining City on the hill anymore

981
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,711
That was over

982
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:21,599
For the court in case number 10 1491

983
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:25,695
Kiobel and others vs Royal Dutch petroleum company and others

984
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:31,327
Indian the court decided to rule in favor of shell and Royal Dutch petroleum

985
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:35,423
Wrote the decision in 1822

986
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:41,311
But no nation has ever yet pretended to be the Customs moron of the whole world the guardian of morals

987
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,335
The whole world

988
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:49,503
It's just a matter of common sense that when Congress passes a law it is passing a law that applies in the United States

989
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,783
You're not some other country

990
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,551
Unless

991
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,087
The law tells us otherwise

992
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,671
Regulating conduct abroad

993
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,231
Serious foreign-policy consequences

994
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:03,839
And courts are and should be reluctant to invite such consequences

995
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,655
Unless that is was Congress clearly intended

996
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:13,823
The wasting no reason is that the extraterritorial conduct conduct that's outside the United States

997
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,127
Isn't going to count

998
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,431
It had there has to be some relationship

999
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,711
To the United States

1000
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:23,039
Basically they took the 80s and they clipped its wings

1001
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,575
Do you feel like Z

1002
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:30,975
I'll tell you the read that they start bringing my mind and I'm wondering if you would agree or you

1003
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,023
Stupid

1004
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,863
The sense that I have with the ATS is that

1005
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,703
It came about in the moment great idealism and Hope

1006
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:44,287
And now after the fog has cleared so to speak

1007
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,103
It seems to represent not

1008
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,895
Hope it knife day

1009
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,431
The fact that we think

1010
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,711
We can change the world

1011
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,759
It's that easy

1012
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:59,135
The 80s and that it's falling out of favor somehow represents in a way that way in which we fall

1013
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,695
And had a kind of sober Awakening

1014
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,511
I wonder do you feel like human rights

1015
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,351
In the way we understood it is dead

1016
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,119
Now it's

1017
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,935
I think it's transformed our idealism

1018
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,471
But maybe

1019
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:18,079
The disaster in kiobel was a moment of kind of stepping back

1020
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,871
To think a bit more broadly

1021
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,919
Play about how we can make the world a better

1022
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:26,271
And Samuel moyn says we do need to rethink some things

1023
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,831
Maybe frankly it's a little dishonest to judge

1024
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:32,671
Pretend the America brings Justice to the world

1025
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,975
America was founded on the idea of

1026
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,023
Human right now which was the first nation in the hist

1027
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:40,607
For the world to be found it explicitly on such an idea which is

1028
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:44,703
It's not really true nns Dave presented their cases

1029
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,775
The human rights movement leaves out how much

1030
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:52,639
The United States has often been involved in the evil they're portraying in court

1031
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:56,479
So at the very least he says that what this decision shows us is that

1032
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,039
Before we run around judging other countries

1033
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,599
To take a hard look at ourselves

1034
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:07,231
More importantly and we can avoid the question what's the best bang for our buck

1035
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,023
It's just not

1036
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,071
Proven yet that 80s is it

1037
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,607
He said all you really had was

1038
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:16,959
A few individuals who won cases and by the way most of them never got any money

1039
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,239
Really

1040
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,263
Yeah

1041
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,055
Dali didn't get paid

1042
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,847
You know after she won

1043
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,871
Kenya flag

1044
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,639
Again

1045
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:29,759
And so in a way that the alien tort statute didn't have far to fall to begin with

1046
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,807
Symbolic victory

1047
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,599
You could definitely see it that way

1048
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,671
Do you feel like you got Justice

1049
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,207
Did what did you get here today

1050
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,023
Badali Florida good

1051
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,047
Doesn't

1052
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,327
You didn't get

1053
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,863
Any money back correct

1054
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,191
Yeah but it never was for important for the money

1055
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,495
Indecent the money won't pay

1056
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,055
Don't blame me rafelito

1057
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,847

Not normal you live album

1060
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,807
I know how to say that they need some time but

1061
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,111
There was a tree song

1062
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,207
Yes

1063
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,255
I lost a brother

1064
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,047
Baidu

1065
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:20,703
When we won that case he knew you're in United States I get so many other brothers NC

1066
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:23,007
Easter through all over the world

1067
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,799
Nothing fine

1068
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,103

1074
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:20,351
So the debate about the 80s and America's role in the world continues the court just heard our

1075
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,911
Arguments in another 80s case this term

1076
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,959
Call Jester Viera Bank

1077
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,519
It's a suit brought by nearly six

1078
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:30,335
Thousand plaintiffs against a Jordan based Bank

1079
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:34,431
Accused of financing terrorism

1080
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:38,527
That the court will use the case to further limit the 80s but

1081
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,343
Dermals piercing
