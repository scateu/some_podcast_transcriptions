Right yeah you asking me

17
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,736

If you vote if you've always true I know like

19
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:34,208
College-educated super Progressive human beings were like why would I ever voted to the exact

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,200

27
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968

00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Seem like

00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
The bottom fell out

68
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:41,440

The American dream

75
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
I mean it's pretty hard when a lot of people around you got a nice things and they got them because they're doing

76
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
Doing something illegal

77
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,224

He said also when he was 10 he wanted pair of shoes he couldn't afford them trailer

82
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,631

83
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399

Romani and they she gave them some money but not enough

88
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,639
How to make up the difference they went out and they

89
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,943
Stole people's empty soda bottle

90
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479

Throwing up pop bottles

94
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
That was my first

95
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
Experience with

96
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
Illegal money

97
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
Doing pop bottle

98
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,839
Show everything else bands from there

99
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:58,239
Fast forward a couple years James has more ground he starts doing some petty crime and he starts breaking into house

100
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:02,335
They think they actually gave me a name call me to pants pocket burglar

101
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,407
When the crime would happen burglar would take only

102
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
Japanese pocket

103
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,295
Big purses and jewelry no merchandise didn't fit in his pocket he wouldn't take it

104
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
That was you

105
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,623
I'm not admitting that was me

106
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
Possible deniability

107
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
Children's tumor names

108
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Vibram acne

109
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,255
Gothic V

110
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,631
James start stealing bigger things and he starts getting arrested

111
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,423
Tattooing in and out of Courts

112
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,239
And then one of those small in that cases

113
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,311
Became I think American legal

114
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,359
They got me out of car

115
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,151
92 cops pulling over

116
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,991
Pull me out the car they say you have the right to remain silent anything and went to that little

117
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
Protocol whatever

118
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,087
They tell him some burglaries that happened in that area

119
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,623
And I think they said I did them

120
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Will you move

121
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
David

122
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,303
The time I've been doing some margaritas or whatever but anyway

123
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,351
James said he didn't do this one

124
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
And if they didn't have the proof

125
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,423
He was driving around in his car

126
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
When they pick them up

127
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,983
When they arrested me I'm thinking

128
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,567
They didn't really have a case against me they didn't catch me breaking into a house

129
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
You got me out of car

130
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,639
An old fingerprints nowhere

131
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,943
He thinks he can win

132
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,247
Okay so I'm not going to jury trial

133
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,271
And

134
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,831
The mere fact that you and I are talking about

135
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,855
James Batson

136
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,159
Case 30 plus years later

137
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
Is amazing

138
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:27,071
That's a prosecutor my name is Joe Gutman I'm from Louisville Kentucky

139
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,631
Griffin little raised in Louisville

140
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:36,031
Want to be a lawyer since he was a kid my parents would through a divorce when I was very young and I wanted to go to law school to help.

141
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:42,431
Kids and divorce has the bats in case he's 26 years old and had just be

142
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:48,063
Become a lawyer change this case was in the first six months that I was in the prosecutor's office

143
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
Pretty impressive first year

144
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Starting out

145
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,951
I lost my first date trial

146
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
Really

147
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
Batson's case you know this low-level burglary of breaking of a house in a purse being stolen he was a go

148
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,191
Maybe this will be my twin be evidence

149
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,239
Disappeared that he was guilty of the crime

150
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
James was

151
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,567
Accused identified as the one is having done it

152
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,967
Two eyewitnesses they're saying James these Witnesses photos of him before

153
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
Because

154
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
Do you need naps

155
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
So

156
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,087
To come to the case

157
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
It goes to trial

158
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,415
And had a hung jury

159
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
They end up being a hung jury

160
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,975
Hip hip hooray

161
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,767
It means they can come to unanimous to

162
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
James gets off

163
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,655
Why was it a hung jury in Kentucky you have to have a unanimous vote

164
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,471
So the defense is looking for that one juror

165
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,799
The keeps from convicting there is apparently one juror

166
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,639
Who just didn't buy it then by the evidence and thought James was legit

167
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
It was a black

168
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
One black lady came to visit me

169
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
After Drew's over

170
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,063
She said I really really don't think you're guilty the rest of

171
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
The jury

172
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,623
Was trying to make me say that you

173
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,415
Guilty or not guilty

174
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,487
So end up being a hung jury I was disappointed

175
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
At that point I was

176
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,071
Having second thoughts about

177
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
Is this the right career for me

178
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
SoJO gottman

179
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:11,263
He says imma try this case one more time it was pretty close to guilty

180
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,567
I have this one juror who hung it up

181
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:17,407
Tell me two or more time and it does something this time

182
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,199
A little differently

183
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:25,599
Just a setup as you know when you get a jury summons you go in you're on a jury pool

184
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,999
At the beginning of a trial

185
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,399
Jury selection

186
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:44,799
Eddie asked you touching you're outside the prosecution the defense sometimes the judge they give jurors into a room and they start

187
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:51,199
Lots of question is there anyone here who has been the victim of a crime

188
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:57,599
Victims of crime

189
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:05,023
To figure out which stores do we want

190
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,119
Member of a church do we want to get rid of

191
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:15,519
And that's the more important part of this process which jurors do we want to toss office jury pool

192
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,359
So what are the rules to get rid of jurors

193
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:23,455
There's two ways to get rid of jurors to get down to that group of 12 in this

194
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,271
And the first way is called striking

195
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,599
Cause this type of me to excuse him for causing this time

196
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:35,999
Tracking for cause is like when they ask you can you be fair in this case if you say you know Noah

197
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:40,351
I really can't I really strong feelings about the people or the subject matter

198
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:45,471
That's a strike for cause or it's like hey that lady who's sitting in the chair of the defendant

199
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
That's some

200
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
That's my cousin

201
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
We grew up together

202
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,871
Roll a complex Venture Lane kombucha that's my boss

203
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,943
We go out every Saturday for brunch whatever it is

204
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
You're too close to this

205
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,551
You can't be fair got it so that one's cause

206
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,903
That's pretty much common sense it makes sense to everyone but the second way is

207
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,463
The heart of this whole matter this whole story

208
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
It's called a peremptory challenge

209
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
Preempt reroute

210
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Peremptory

211
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,399
That's a word depending on how you punch it into Google

212
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,799
It'll be like that's a type of a son what does it mean what is peremptory meet Brenda challenge means you get a certain number of straw

213
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,127
Just to get rid of people you think might not be

214
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
Fair to you

215
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,991
But you can really use them anyway you want and but these

216
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Strikes

217
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
You want to give any reason

218
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
How many days do you get

219
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,135
So it varies from state-to-state in some states

220
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
20 in other states

221
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
It's for

222
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,255
In Kentucky then and now each side gets

223
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
88 juror

224
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:48,447
Did they just get to put the Exxon and say you're not going to sit on this trial hooker truck

225
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,751
They don't explain anything and this isn't just some

226
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
Weird legal rules we made up

227
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
Like 20 years ago this is something

228
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
Has been around

229
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
It's older than America

230
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,711
Goes back to England in the 11th century

231
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,759
And before that some say he goes back to like

232
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,343
104 BC Roman times really really

233
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,671
And the idea is I feel like the visualization is like

234
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
Seesaw

235
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
Like okay

236
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,047
We need to get to this perfect group of 12 people and

237
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
You know there's going to be people who are biased either side so each side gets the eliminate people you get three you get

238
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,239
You get for you get for and then we'll

239
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,543
Come to this balance in the jury

240
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
A group of people

241
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,615
Port going to be fair

242
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,687
Tilted their way from other side

243
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:36,831
The thinking is Atlanta balance yet and also the thinking was that this would give outside more faith in the process and

244
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,855
At the same time

245
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,135
Protect both sides

246
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
From

247
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
Tyranny of a trial judge

248
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
How to hack

249
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,255
Power cannot you're okay

250
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,327
What happens in this case is the second trial begins

251
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
Take me to the

252
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,143
Mama Theresa

253
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
Imagine early

254
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
Yeah that's that's the first thing that

255
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
Well

256
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055
The only people that were in the courtroom

257
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,663
Were some family members of mr. Batson his attorney a detective

258
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
And me

259
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
And the jury

260
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:08,063
So the reason we're talking about this case and Joe gottman and James Batson

261
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,903
Is because the next thing that happens is Joe Gutman gets up there

262
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,511
He scans the jury pool and at this point he says there are 13 people left

263
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
For that were black

264
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,863
9 that were white and he uses his peremptory challenges

265
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,911
The strike off 1

266
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
2

267
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
3

268
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
4

269
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Blacture

270
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
They're all gone

271
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
Leaving all white

272
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,359
Do you remember

273
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Striking

274
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
For minority

275
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:38,271
Do I specifically remember

276
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,551
The reason for each

277
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
No I don't

278
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,159
I asked Joe was the reason because they were

279
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
In fact

280
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
Black no

281
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,511
I can see that they were not stricken

282
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
Because of rice

283
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,327
And I remember

284
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,655
Specifically did one of the jurors lived in the neighborhood

285
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,007
Yes exactly remember what his reasons were for all four black jurors but

286
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:04,895
What's important for our story is to know that James Batson is sitting there in the room

287
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,455
As all of this is happening

288
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:12,063
Just completely strikeout

289
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
Damn right I told my lawyer

290
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,159
Projector that you know

291
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,439
Voices by rev jet

292
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
James said because

293
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
Not fair

294
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,071
He should know it's a long-standing rule he's allowed to do that

295
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,631
Sprite what we want

296
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
He was white

297
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
He was white

298
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,615
Inside nose for people that have just been struck off the jury they're burning the courtroom was white

299
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,175
So again

300
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:43,295
Jo Malone YouTube Jack and again

301
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,647
What you mean you can't you work for me you do what I say you just check anyway

302
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,695
I don't care as long standing rule

303
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,999
And he did

304
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,327
And it all came behind that one objection

305
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
Yeah

306
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
What happened

307
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,495
Is after the jury was select

308
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,031
Dugdale

309
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
James Attorney

310
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
Said

311
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,639
Judge how I want to make an objection

312
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,431
We went up to the bench

313
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
He said

314
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:16,063
Your honor you can see there's an all-white jury I would like for him to explain his strikes

315
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,879
But before I could get another word out of my mouth

316
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,183
Judge Ryan said Mr gottman

317
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
Does not have to explain his rights

318
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,999
It's not the law

319
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
Let's move on

320
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Move on

321
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,143
So they moved on with an all-white jury

322
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
I got found guilty

323
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
I got 20 years

324
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Yes

325
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
Sebastian goes to prison

326
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
Danville KY

327
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
His first move when he got there

328
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,575
Appeal immediately

329
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:54,207
And ultimately his appeal ends up in the hands of the sky David niehaus

330
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,767
Jefferson County public defenders

331
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Office

332
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,351
Anyhow decide to do something

333
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Ambitious

334
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
What we did is

335
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
We call it taking

336
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
A tour of the jurisdiction

337
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,263
Washington

338
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
Khalid

339
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,359
Electrical Eagle Road Trip

340
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,175
Sammy house and his team start looking at other states

341
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
Looking at other regions to find out what this is

342
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
Problem

343
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,295
Elsewhere is this just something

344
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,343
Limited to the South or is it

345
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
Something else

346
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,695
Give me like are people in other places doing what Joe got midday

347
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:35,935
And when he found is that this was happening pretty much everywhere

348
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
So

349
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
They filed an appeal

350
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,031
Which worked its way up to the courts

351
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
And

352
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,591
In December 1985

353
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:49,759
Thank you gentlemen vacation submitted to hear arguments next year in Kentucky

354
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,807

The Supreme Court of the United States

356
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
I get a call one day

357
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:00,255
From the Associated Press at checkup

358
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279
How do you feel about the

359
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
Supreme Court accepting

360
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,911
Case of James Kirkland Batson and I was almost speechless and

361
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
I did

362
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,615
Go just to observe and learn

363
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,431
Mister chief justice and may please the court

364
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,479
So here's out ultimately went down

365
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
Bat inside my house

366
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,623
He argues that these strikes were being used take black people off

367

00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,119
And the 6th Amendment

371
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:42,751
What does the right to a jury of your peers representative of the community as possible

372
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,335
So if Lewisville is like 17% black

373
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,127
The jury's probably be about

374
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,151
17% black

375
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,199
And the prosecutor shouldn't be allowed to

376
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,247
Askew that without having to give a reason

377
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
Most of all

378
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,367
Kentucky's response to requests

379
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,183
We Believe

380
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:05,279
The historical nature and function of the device itself to Kentucky saying

381
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:09,887
We shouldn't have to justify these strikes the court has told us that again and again

382
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,447
Is always been unsettled enough controlled by the court

383
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,495
Unexplained and his practice

384
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,799
Centuries and

385
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,127
Yes and maybe some of uses but this is a tool that lawyers need

386
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,711
Thank you gentleman McKay's this semester

387
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,551
4 months later the court delivers it

388
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
Its verdict

389
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,135
And in a seven to two decision

390
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
Batten wood

391
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:39,071
The court found that the prosecutor's actions for sure violated the 14th Amendment

392
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,911
They said racial discrimination of any kind in jury selection

393
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
Is not allowed

394
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
Que Dan Rather

395
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,287
The high court ruling today it is illegal

396
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,615
Illegal even on a Grand Prix challenge it is illegal

397
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,687
For a lawyer to reject a juror on the basis of race

398
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,247
James Batson sentence with immediately vacate

399
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
How's that feel

400
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,063
Can you send describe them

401
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,903
If you imprison and you know your sentence is being taken away

402
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,511
Talk to break every now and then and then

403
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,791
It's coefficient come up

404
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,095
Be hanging out playing chess

405
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,655
I got a loan and logbooks Batson rule

406
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,727
And that was the biggest eel

407
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
Of all this

408
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
The headline

409
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,567
This new

410
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,919
Rett syndrome named after him

411
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
Justices put new limits

412
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:34,111
What it's called free MP3 challenge the bathroom the bathroom is an echo of what

413
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:40,511
You see people minorities getting booted off of a jury you can say your honor I think that's a violation

414
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,327
In the other side B of the Defence of the prosecution

415
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,119
Pasta provide non

416
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,399
Racial reasons

417
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
For why they eliminated that chair

418
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,983
And for a lot of people this is a break

419
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,799
This is like finally we figured out how to do this right

420
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:59,199
There was a system in place to protect everyone and that system was even extended to civil cases and eventually the women is

421
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:05,599
It was a big deal when the case was decided and the initial elation

422
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,135
Was quickly

423
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,159
Tempered

424
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,231
With a strong dose of reality

425
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,119
This is Jeff Robinson he's a director of the ACLU Center for chest

426
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,935
Because what bats and prevents is

427
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
Deliberate

428
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
Racial

429
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
Discrimination

430
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,847
And I almost immediately

431
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
All over the country

432
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,711
Prosecutor started training each other teaching

433
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:37,087
Each other on how to get around Batson Equal justice initiative

434
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,367
In Montgomery Alabama

435
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,415
Train is all across the country

436
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,951
Some of these are on video

437
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,743
And I found one

438
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,399
Made it on YouTube when you're picking up jewelry you got to stay these basic rule this is one of those videos this one

439
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:56,799
In the Philadelphia prosecutor named Jack man lecturing to a room full of young prosecutors on how to pick a jury

440
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,591
Selecting black

441
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,919
You don't want the real educated ones and my screen is black

442
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:08,319
Women young black women are very bad there's an antagonism I guess maybe cuz they're downtrodden

443
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:17,023
So there are downtrodden to areas and they somehow want to take it out on somebody and you don't want it to be you

444
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:24,703
The crazy thing about this video is that it was film just a few months after the Baton decision

445
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,775
Batson vs Kentucky I'm sure you've all become aware of that

446
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,615
Casey Jackson man basically tells his prosecutors look we got this new rule

447
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:36,735
Here's how you break it you strike the black person off the jury but just say it's for another reason

448
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,039
Because that's what Batson required

449
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:44,159
This is a racially neutral reason

450
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,231
When you do have a black shirt you question them at like and

451
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:53,119
Honest Little Chute that you have Mark something down that you can articulate later time if something happened

452
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,911
Las Vegas strike three blacks

453
00:20:55,167 --> 00:21:01,311
Start with first three people write it down right then and there I'd rather ride in my little box there you know the woman had a kid

454
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:05,151
About the same age as defendant and I thought you be sympathetic to amore

455
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:11,551
She's unemployed and I just don't like unemployed people because I find enough today before this is almost this training to create

456
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,087
Catalog of reasons

457
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,135
Put on the face where race-neutral

458
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,208
Just say you're excluding them because they're too tall

459
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,864
Are there 200 that person was wearing a black sweater things like well he lives in a bad neighborhood

460
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,728
The person would maintain eye contact body language or they belong to a church

461
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
Tattoos

462
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
What are a nurse

463
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
Any of those reasons have a markdown

464
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:38,944
As long as a prosecutor doesn't say I excused that person because they're black

465
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,248
That's some says it's completely okay

466
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,344
I was actually working on a case

467
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,136
This is lawyer Bryan Stevenson

468
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:51,744
My office said the time was called the southern Christmas depends who it is who's and I was in Atlanta Georgia

469
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
Butterfly Boucher

470
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,816
Alabama and when was this

471
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
This is 1986

472
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,680
And we were defending someone down in Swainsboro Georgia

473
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,216
Guy by the name of Gamble

474
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:05,312
And the bathroom decision came down

475
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,712
I and objections were made with the prosecutor used his peremptory strikes exclude all of the African-American

476
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,808
And we said wait a minute you're on if there's a new decision Batson vs Kentucky

477
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,600
Which means that the prosecutor can't do this

478
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:23,232
And the courts at while I read baton. What this means is the price going to have to give race-neutral reason

479
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,536
The prosecution I've got my race-neutral Visa

480
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,096
Is Weis truck this woman

481
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:33,216
Because she looks just like the defendant there was an African American man to wait a minute what is that

482
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,264
No she doesn't

483
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,336
He said it's not judge that I see that you did

484
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:42,432
What struck this man because he lives in South Waynesboro

485
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,968
And that's where the defendant

486
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:48,064
And we record the sale of all the black people live in South Waynesboro

487
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
All the way to

488
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,904
That's not a reason to reason. You know that is erased

489
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,208
He said I stop one person

490
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,536
Because this man was in the military and he was discharged

491
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,584
After 5 years in the military

492
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,376
And in my experience or honor

493
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:05,728
You only get discharged honorably after an even number of years

494
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,104
What a juror was put back on the stand was so where were you discharged from the military honorably yes I was

495
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
I was actually decorated

496
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,200
I got this metal I got this award I got these things

497
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,992
Well I still accept the Prosecco

498
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,272
Kids reading for excluding that

499
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,064
A person my favorite was

500
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:25,440
The prosecution gets better

501
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,744
This man because he testified

502
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,024
That he was a mason

503
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,376
Any said you're on I just don't want anybody who's a member of a masonic lodge

504
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:37,216
All my jewelry they have their own code their own rituals are all culture

505
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
I don't want that

506
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:42,848
The jury was put back on the stand we asked her are you a member of the Masonic Lodge

507
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,408
I've never said no I'm not he said I'm a brick mason

508
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,552
And the judge says I still know what you mean I'll let you exclude that person right

509
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:55,136
And so almost from the very beginning there was this

510
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,208
Cynicism this gameplay I used to tell people

511
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:01,536
Bath is not going to eliminate racial bias in jury selection

512
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:05,376
But it will make the jury selection process a lot more entertaining

513
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:08,448
Y'all should come to court and just watch the show

514
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,080
So you not only did Batson

515
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,152
Not change anything but that's in made things worse

516
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:22,784
Steven breit put to me is basically

517
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,832
Set of procedures

518
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:29,952
Two sortilege enemies and cover up the race discrimination that's going on

519
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
You had this

520
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,584
Smelly putrid problem of racial discrimination in jury selection

521
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
And instead of

522
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
Tossing it out

523
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
We just

524
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,192
Sprayed Febreeze

525
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,240
It's kind of perfume

526
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,800
Vaguely cheap cologne it's still there

527
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,592
Begley hidden

528
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,152
And now with the Batson rule

529
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,200
If you think the prosecution or the

530
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,272
Defense is striking people off because of race

531
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,576
You have to call them out and then you have to

532
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,600
Somehow

533
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:01,184
Try and prove that the reason they're providing is a lie

534
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,208
And that's

535
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
Really really Tiff

536
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
Since

537
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,632
1986 Ford xample in the state of Washington

538
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,656
There been

539
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:17,312
Probably 4748 challenges on baton issues where people have been convicted make said waiting

540
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,360
The prosecutors were excusing

541
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,152
People of color from the jury

542
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,944
Because they were people of color

543
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:27,040
Out of those 46 250 challenges there's been one

544
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:27,808
River

545
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,880
The state of Tennessee has not reversed a single case

546
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
Under Batson

547
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:36,000
And the 30 years for it's inside the Baton decision came out

548
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:42,400
As a result he says there still many counties in America where the diversity of the jury is not increase

549
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,680
Very much at all

550
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,800
So for example in one Louisiana Parish they looked a felony cases

551
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,592
Is over an eight-year period

552
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,896
And found it nearly half the black jurors

553
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
Horse track

554
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,224
Houston County Alabama

555
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
Over a five-year period

556
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,600
The date established at 80% of the African Americans qualify for jury service

557
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:08,256
80% 80% and that's in death penalty cases so

558
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:11,072
I mean if you think about that like a big percent of time Deezer

559
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,352
Lawyers who are

560
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,912
Going around the bathroom rule going on the Block

561
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:18,496
Going on the Constitution to get these all-white juries

562
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,800
Who are then oftentimes pudding

563
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
Black

564
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,336
Mint

565
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,104
To death

566
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
And

567
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,664
That reminds you some pretty dark

568
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,504
Super Bass

569
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
I mean

570
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
That video

571
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
Training video

572
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
The assumption that video is it

573
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Having black

574
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
People on the tree

575
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,000
Would hurt that guy

576
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
Would hurt the

577
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
Yeah

578
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,096
Show me Justice

579
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,632
Assume that orbit is there any

580
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,424
Any data that would say that's even remotely

581
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,984
Be true the hardest thing about looking at this stuff

582
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,264
Analytically

583
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544
The juries are like

584
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Black Box

585
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
They don't let

586
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
Journalist

587
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,432
Academics in

588
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
Often

589
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
Study

590
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,248
What's going on

591
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,528
Two trees kind of sacred that

592
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552
Yeah but

593
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,600
The few times we've gotten data like to do

594
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,136
This group called the capital jury brought

595
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
That looks it

596
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
Data speed

597
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,696
SafeLink application

598
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,232
Because that's where the stuff ends up being like

599
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
Life or death

600
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,792
So they looked at data in

601
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,608
Like 350 cases in 14 States

602
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,424
Over a number of years and they found that

603
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
White man

604
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:27,360
Are more likely to go for the death penalty than black men when you get to sentencing that number that the difference between

605
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,152
White and black is really exaggerated

606
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
White men are

607
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:33,248
Are seven times more likely to want the death penalty

608
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
Is in a black person

609
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,064
There's another study that was done in Florida

610
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,904
Amazon look at felony cases over like 10 years and

611
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
They found that

612
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,952
All-white jury pools

613
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,744
In Florida convicted black defendants

614
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,768
16

615
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
Percent

616
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
More often

617
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:52,960
Okay but was really interesting is that Gap was practically eliminated when at least one member of the jury pool

618
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,264
Black Interstate but one black person

619
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
And that difference

620
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
Yeah and catastrophes

621
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,128
Why I mean

622
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,432
Types of criminal cases

623
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,248
Usually involve cops and the reason is often cited is

624
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,040
That nope black

625
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,576
Jurors are less likely

626
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,600
To believe

627
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
Cops

628
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,928
Bikers are more likely to

629
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,464
Insert some sense of

630
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
Suspicion

631
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,000
Into

632
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,840
The states are the Commonwealth or whatever is tested

633
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,144
And almost everyone talked to

634
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,680
Gave me a version of this

635
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,496
That that you know we have black going to jury to deliberate more

636
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:30,336
And that black people are less likely to trust law enforcement especially

637
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,616
Jack McMahon

638
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:36,736
Who was the guy we heard from in that video

639
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:38,784
Antivirus

640
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
Personage

641
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
Could ever imagine

642
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,880
Stone Cold liberal

643
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:47,744
To the nth degree but I was talking about practicality

644
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,024
Jewelry backpack

645
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,584
I still stand by that

646
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,424
The man asked you this

647
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,984
And you're trying to drug test

648
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,568
And the defendant is going to claim that the

649
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,592
Cops online

650
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152
Okay

651
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,176
You're the

652
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
What

653
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,016
Demographic group

654
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,040
It had more

655
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
Bossier

656
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
The police live

657
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
Then

658
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,648
Minority

659
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,440
They have seen

660
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,464
Police

661
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
Lionville belief police

662
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,536
Live more than

663
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:26,144
Some white guy lives in a rich area believes that police officer every everything he says

664
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,960
I'm so is the prosecutor you're trying to win the case

665
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,496
And that persons not going

666
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
The person is going to be

667
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
Questioning

668
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
Witnesses

669
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,848
And you're given the Opera

670
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
Opportunity

671
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,944
True peremptory challenges to strike them why wouldn't you

672
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,968
Give me a full mattress

673
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
Well I guess

674
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:44,832
I see the argument that you know use your friend challenges

675
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:49,696
To get the best you can to win but doesn't eliminating a black

676
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:53,536
Jerry because you believe they might have certain biases against app

677
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,840
Police officer versus a white juror

678
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,144
In some way violate

679
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,192
The equal protection Clause of the

680
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:00,960
The 14th

681
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,752
I don't think so

682
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,800
Not at all because

683
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,080
It's not because of

684
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,104
The color of their skin

685
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,408
Cause of there

686
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,432
Demographic

687
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
And where

688
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,528
Sidle demographic

689
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,600
The fact of life

690
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,416
I think those Facts of Life in those societal

691
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,208
Demographical Concepts

692
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,256
All stem from the color of

693
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,328
Their skin

694
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,376
Maybe a deeper issue that we can't deal with

695
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
Jury selection

696
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
But you're right

697
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
But the reality is

698
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,520
The reality is that that that that's what this

699
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,056
Situation is so

700
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,104
So you're saying that if you're the prosecutor you

701
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,896
You should stay out for this guy will probably be worse.

702
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,688
For me he probably

703
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,528
Believe those cops online but I'm going to take him because I want to uphold the

704
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,392
There is no prosecutor in the country

705
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,720
I want to I want to show my altruism

706
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,512
And I'm going to keep this guy on my

707
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,536
Jewelry who made this

708
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,304
Believe my

709
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,328
Accentuate

710
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632
Because I want to be altruistic

711
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:19,040
How to solve a problem like Batson

712
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:25,440
More perfect will continue

713
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,904
This is more perfect miniseries about

714
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,280
Supreme Court on Jad abumrad explain how we got into this hole

715
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
Brass about

716
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,840
Racial bias in Jerusalem

717
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:04,864
I think we should

718
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:11,520
It's because of a case it was in front of the Supreme Court this term in case 1483

719
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,288
49

720
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,824
Foster versus Chapman

721
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,360
So basic facts

722
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,408
This is a murder case in Georgia

723
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:23,808
A younger black man kills an elderly white woman the prosecutors dismiss a bunch of black Jersey

724
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,648
Is and the defense having this new Batson rule says hold up

725
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
Can't do that

726
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,208
And prosecutors give

727
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,280
These race-neutral reasons and the judge says

728
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,304
That looks good to me

729
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:40,704
Years later something sort of incredible happens through like one of those Freedom of Information Act

730
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,240
Type things

731
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,776
The defense actually gets

732
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,312
See the notes

733
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
Prosecution

734
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
Should had

735
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,128
During the

736
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,920
Trial the notes they kept her in

737
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:56,064
Jury selection this is one of those rare times when we pull back the curtain and we find out what the prosecutors were doing

738
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,440
This is lawyer Steven breit he actually argued Foster case in front of Supreme Court late last year

739
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:05,792
And he says what you saw these notes was that the prosecution

740
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:09,632
They literally wrote a little B next to the name

741
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:14,240
Each and every black juror B1 B2 B3

742
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:20,640
Highlighting all the black sand in in green on the list of all the people summoned for jury

743
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,712
Racial discrimination is really hard to prove

744
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,528
This is actual physical proof

745
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:32,928
In a file in the state like this is the Smoking Gun we've been waiting for so what are the what are the prosecutor

746
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,720
How did the prosecution argue in front of

747
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:38,304
Prosecution was like you know what actually wants an ultrasound they said

748
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:42,400
We were just riding those bees because we wanted to make sure we notice

749
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,704
The black jurors you want to keep track of them

750
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,008
4 months

751
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:53,152
Project trial defense counsel

752
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,712
That's lawyer representing Georgia Beth Burton

753
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:00,320
And she saying of course we're going to notice race this is the post Batson world end

754
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,624
We're going to no trace and we're going to write it down

755
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,024
I would be more surprised quite frankly if there wasn't some sort of highlighting or

756
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,376
Is that the reason he highlighted

757
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,168
Actors in green

758
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,960
He being the original prosecutor

759
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,824
What about the black jurors and did all these different things

760
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,640
Was because he was preparing defense in case

761
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,968
Correct. Justice Breyer asking

762
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,760
Well why didn't you make that

763
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
Argument

764
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:31,808
Like

765
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,624
When the case was actually happening the years and years ago

766
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,768
What isn't a little surprising

767
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,560
But he never thought of it

768
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:47,168
Didn't tell anybody

769
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,264
I would say that's on

770
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,616
The good news is that

771
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,456
In a 7 to 1 decision this

772
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
Supreme Court agreed

773
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
That

774
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,040
Is prosecutors reasons War

775
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,576
Utterly ridiculous

776
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,904
I'm just going to ask you

777
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,720
Violation

778
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,512
That's Justice Kagan

779
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,560
I don't think it is

780
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,096
Is that

781
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,680
This case was in front of supreme court at all

782
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:23,264
Good at to get appealed up to the highest court in the land

783
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,544
Before someone said

784
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,336
Oh yeah that's about annihilation

785
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,616
That's how hard it is

786
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:31,456
And the Supreme Court though it made a forceful

787
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,992
Decision 7 out of 8

788
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,528
Didn't make a new rule

789
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,624
This is not works offer up

790
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,696
Datsun 2.0 or didn't double down or throw it out or

791
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
You send me Ruel

792
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,280
No they said this is really wrong but

793
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,072
Didn't go as far to say

794
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,352
Because it doesn't work

795
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,632
So we still got bats

796
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,752
So okay if we want to diverse juries and

797
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
We know that Batson

798
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
Work

799
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,848
What do we do

800
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,872
So I asked

801
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,152
Everyone I talked to

802
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
That question

803
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,224
Got a lot of different answers

804
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,248
But this was the obvious

805
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
Amanda Nance

806
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,064
Margaret was a professor of law

807
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,088
IIT

808
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:09,856
Chicago Kent

809
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,136
College of Law

810
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,416
What I'd like to

811
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
The court to do

812
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,464
Is eliminate

813
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,280
Peremptory challenges who is a no-brainer

814
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,840
Again steambrite is a lawyer we have to

815
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,168
Supreme Court gives you these rules

816
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,704
Appropriate challenges

817
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,752
And then says

818
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:33,152
Well wait a minute don't just break people you know you were going to look into all the ways that you strike the people wouldn't give him at all that for crying out loud

819
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:37,504
Simple even Jack man the guy from that training video he was open to

820
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,904
We've had 30 years of experiment with Batson and it's not working

821
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:50,304
We now have to go the route that Justice Marshall suggested back in Batson

822
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,704
So in the bathroom decision you got Thurgood Marshall

823
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,336
Marshall like the most important attorney in the Civil Rights Movement turn the first black Supreme Court Justice

824
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,128
Key in the same paragraph

825
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,664
Call the Baton decision

826
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,688
Historic

827
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,040
And then said this isn't going to work this decision isn't going to do anything

828
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:15,392
He was basically a fortune teller he said both those things in the same breath

829
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,720
In one paragraph he starts about going this decision today

830
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,488
Historic

831
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,768
By the end of the paragraph

832
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,840
You're never going to fix this until you get rid of print through town

833
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:30,240
Set an alarm for 9 breakfast just do away with broom tri-strike

834
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:34,080
Constitution

835
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,872
1st Ave

836
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,920
Art denied

837
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:44,576
Peremptory challenge

838
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,112
Peremptory challenges

839
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:52,256
You will have discrimination but what surprised me most and Reporting this story is that like I talk to people

840
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:57,632
On the left side of the criminal justice system on the right side of Criminal Justice is ACLU types

841
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,680
Law professors academics

842
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:02,496
Conservative prosecutors

843
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:06,592
Guys we got to get rid of printer challenges right almost every single one

844
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,872
Will say no

845
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
No

846
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:15,296
Crucially important to organisms it's an easy solution just get rid of

847
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,832
Peremptory Sahel

848
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:23,232
Italian style are legal editor law professor sunwolf from Santa Clara University and lawyer David niehaus again

849
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,536
And here's one of the arguments

850
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:31,680
If you take these things away all the decisions about striking jurors would be made by the judge

851
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:37,568
On the question whether Jerry could be fair and impartial and for that to work you have to have a fair job

852
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
And

853
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,896
There are an awful lot of judges

854
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,920
Who aren't there

855
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,224
Here's another argument I heard from Jeffrey Robbins

856
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:44,992
Jason from the ACLU

857
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,808
And this is based on my experience

858
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,600
34 years in the criminal justice

859
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:54,464
Jeff Robinson says if you can find some way to take race out of the equation

860
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,744
Parentheses

861
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,024
Super useful

862
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,304
Call Annie told me about this one

863
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,352
Case very high-profile homicide

864
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,632
Lakes in the state of Washington

865
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,168
This case

866
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,728
Was incredibly complicated and also

867
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,520
Potentially involved

868
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,568
A coerced confession

869
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,104
Buy some undercover cop

870
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
Sand

871
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,920
There's a police officer on the jury pay

872
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
He says

873
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,480
I can be fair

874
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,040
I know the police officers that investigated this

875
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,088
I've worked with him before

876
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,648
I think they're really good people but don't worry

877
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,672
I can be fair

878
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,464
Everything about his back

879
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,000
Was saying

880
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,816
I do not want this man to serve on this

881
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,864
But he was saying

882
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,144
I can be fair

883
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,448
I could not exclude him

884
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,728
Moana challenge

885
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496
Call

886
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:39,776
Why not

887
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:46,176
Because he said he could be fair the fact that he's a police officer doesn't mean he can't be fair but isn't saying I'm

888
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:52,576
I know some of these people involved in this case enough to get him dismissed for cause it's enough to get more questioning but how well

889
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,856
How do you know I'm not very well

890
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:57,696
So you saying that case if you said okay. Like to dismiss jurors 17-4

891
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,000
For cause the judge would say there's not a record

892
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,304
I don't think any judge in this country

893
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,608
What dismiss that juror for cause

894
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,424
And so a peremptory challenge is important

895
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
So

896
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,728
I've watched

897
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,568
More jury selection videos on YouTube than any person

898
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,616
Evershed and

899
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,920
It's this amazing thing where you see these people

900
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,480
But not necessarily used to being in a courtroom

901
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:25,344
There's certainly not used to be grilled in public by a bunch of people in suits

902
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,136
Take it up there to the jury panel

903
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:32,512
And they got to ask these questions in the trial

904
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,328
Over and over again

905
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,984
Can you be carrying a partial

906
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,056
Nobody says no

907
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,336
Everyone feels like

908
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:49,920
Yes I can be fair

909
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:53,760
I'm thinking I could I can be totally unbiased

910
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:58,112
I think some of them believe that they can actually do this nearly impossible task

911
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:02,720
And others they know they can't but they might say yes anyway

912
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,744
Believe me

913
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,280
Knows the bias Jersey

914
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:11,936
Comment they don't reveal things they lie about things for people that when you're questioned them in a jury that you know they're lying to you

915
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:16,544
Trying to get onto jewelry or trying to get off the jury bias people are being allowed to serve

916
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,664
So any tools that can help reduce the number of biased years on Jerry

917
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,200
Is essential to just

918
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,272
So yeah if you got a really

919
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:32,672
Crappie outlook on chores and humans then maybe you need more front through challenges but the way Jackie Robinson put it to me was that if you're using parentheses

920
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,952
Challenges the right way

921
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,488
It forces you to be like

922
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,024
Equal opportunity

923
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
Suspicious

924
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:38,816
Suspicious of

925
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,352
Everyone

926
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
And that's

927
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,912
The only way to be fair

928
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,192
My parents

929
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,216
We're both

930
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:48,032
Active in the civil rights movement in Memphis Tennessee

931
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,592
Is activist to people you could ever want to meet

932
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,616
Both black

933
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,199
I would never let my mother

934
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,503
Sit on a criminal defense jury

935
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,087
Because my mother is being about black defendants was

936
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:04,159
You're the reason I have to lock the door in my neighborhood

937
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:07,487
You're the reason that I get disrespected when I go out into the

938
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,255
Community

939
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,047
And I'm going to take it out on you

940
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,095
My father's position

941
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
Would be

942
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,495
I wouldn't believe a police officer if he told me it was raining and the water was coming down on my head

943
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,287
And so what this is about

944
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
Is

945
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,079
Actually

946
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,639
Putting into effect what the rules

947
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,407
Say

948
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:28,223
Talk to jurors and find out what they think

949
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,271
But what about Thurgood Marshall the idea that

950
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,295
You know

951
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:37,695
If you have renter challenges if you give people a way to discriminate they will discriminate well

952
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,023
I was born in 1956

953
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:46,655
It's on 1954 Thurgood Marshall argued Brown versus the Board of Education

954
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,679
Which

955
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,263
Had a significant impact on my life

956
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:57,663
Thurgood Marshall with someone that I have respected and someone I have admired virtually my entire life

957
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:02,527
But I can't agree with him that I want all peremptory challenges eliminated

958
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,599
And why do you think Thurgood Marshall Justice Marshall

959
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:09,439
Went straight to no print Justice Marshall concluded that

960
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:12,255
He did not have faith in America

961
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,071
To be able to make these kind of

962
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
And

963
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,143
I understand why you concluded that

964
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,191
And you do you have that face

965
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,287
I still do

966
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,615
And how long that will last I don't know

967
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,663
But I still do right now

968
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,343
Robinson says that

969
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,975
To give up on these parentheses is like giving up on who we might be one day

970
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,255
Because of

971
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,535
Who we are right now

972
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,559
That's

973
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,583
Conceding

974
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,935
That we are so divided by race that we will never be able

975
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,215
To try and fix it

976
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,263
And I'm not prepared to concede that

977
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:02,687
Okay one last thing for my trip to Louisville

978
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,991
What's up Shane

979
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,807
All right

980
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,111
Thunder blew me away

981
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,951
But I'm Joe Gutman I'm a teacher at Central High School

982
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,487
Also an attorney at law

983
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:18,815
I'm James Batson truck driver and

984
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,119
Construction worker amongst other things

985
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,911
I probably should add that on the

986
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,703
Former prosecutor

987
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,727
Best suitcases

988
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:33,151
Joe gottman and James Batson those two people whose conflict in a courtroom back in 1983 gave us the bathroom

989
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,991
They are now in 2016

990
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,015
Prince

991
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,343
I'll talk to him about time you have to

992
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,207
Yep we're friends now how often is it that a prosecutor becomes friends with someone

993
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,999
He helped convince

994
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:52,351
Not not often I mean retired from a

995
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:55,423
Prosecuting Austin 2001

996
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,959
Ed Cena

997
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,263
Too many awful things

998
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:05,151
To make a long story short it was time for me to do something else

999
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,967
And starts teaching at a high school in Louisville

1000
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,247
80% black

1001
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,551
Where do we wear

1002
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:14,111
Posing drug testing covered on Asuna side

1003
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,903
Jackson

1004
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,463
Well drug testing in schools

1005
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,279
Seems like a good idea but in actuality

1006
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:26,143
So the day I visited Joe gottman's classroom which is like a full-on Mach

1007
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,191
Courtroom in a classroom

1008
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,727
He's doing his mock trials with

1009
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,567
Not be allowed in school

1010
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:36,383
School says no funding for what it's all said and done

1011
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,431
I would prefer to be known

1012
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,223
More 4

1013
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,503
The accomplishments in this

1014
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,271
Classroom

1015
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:45,087
Jennifer Batson

1016
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,951
As for James a baton case

1017
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:52,767
Eventually died from illegal

1018
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,047
Activities

1019
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,071
Andy Roebuck

1020
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,863
War on jail

1021
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,143
Concept

1022
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,423
Me trying to get people

1023
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,703
Stop doing crime

1024
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,239
And the books actually how they

1025
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:05,055
To sort of met up again one day a few years ago

1026
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,871
James came to Jose school to give him a copy

1027
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:14,271
He gave me a copy of his book and asked me if I'd look over it I wanted his opinion on it I read the book that night actually

1028
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,039
And he got

1029
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:15,807
50 books

1030
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,599
Into the school system here in Jeff

1031
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,367
County now

1032
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,999
What happened in the past is in the past

1033
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:27,583
30 years ago he did what he did I did what I did

1034
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,375
Let It Go

1035
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:34,239
As far as a legacy the Batson challenge goes it's really interesting to hear them talk about it

1036
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,519
Especially because

1037
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,335
In the eyes of a lot of people who know these issues

1038
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,919
Joe was a villain that was always the painful part about

1039
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,711
Decision advances

1040
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,503
Is the label of being erased

1041
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,271
Prosecutor

1042
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,295
What does that mean

1043
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,343
Well that was a horrible label

1044
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,391
Yeah I mean so horrible

1045
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,927
Butt bouncing

1046
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
Started

On jury selection in America

1049
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,095
Can maybe I was just

1050
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,935
They're Weatherby fate or whatever

1051
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,983
But this was the start

1052
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,007
Change

1053

1054

Take it for what it's worth

1055
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:16,991
But

1056
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,807
Maybe if Robinson's right we can look at all this

1057
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,575
And

1058
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,599
Have a little
