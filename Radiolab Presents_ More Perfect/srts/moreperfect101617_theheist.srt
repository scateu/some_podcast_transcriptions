00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,104
This is more perfect I'm jad abumrad this week

6
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,664
Conversation about a mystery

7
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:21,760
Chemistry actual is connected to one of my favorite stories we've done so far

8
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:28,160
The political Thicket the political Thicket Court must not enter the political Thicket in the imagery

9
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:33,280
Be at the thicket is that you know the deer very proudly with his new horns

10
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,072
Goes into the thicket

11
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,120
Gets entangled

12
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,168
Can never get out

13
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,728
Frankfurters claim was

14
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:45,824
Once the courts are in there will be nothing Beyond it and someday

15
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:52,480
The courts will be forced to declare winners and losers a very high-profile action

16
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,112
If you haven't heard the story definitely hit pause right now go back in the feed find the story called political Thicket

17
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,392
Listen to is

18
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,672
Definitely one of my favorites

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,024
Essentially the story of a case that many people

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,888
Point to as being the first time that the Supreme Court got into politics

21
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,936
Text with soiled themselves with politics

22
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704
Switch

23
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,032
Make a beeline from that moment to Bush V Gore

24
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,312
That case

25
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,592
1962

26
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,128
So dramatic

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,944
For a court that too

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,480
Literally broke

29
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,248
To Justice

30
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,784
The shattered

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,808
2 human being

32
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,112
And one of those two justices

33
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,160
Justice Felix Frankfurter

34
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,232
Is at the center of the mystery we're about to tell you about

35
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,536
Just to give you a sense of who he was

36
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,096
Play you a little clip from that earlier story

37
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,960
He was extremely smart towering figure but as a person

38
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,240
Justice

39
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,032
Justice Frankfurter

40
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,104
He wasn't necessarily

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
The nicest

42
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,176
Person I heard that from everyone I talk

43
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,224
I always call him a Bantam rooster

44
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,808
He was a difficult Krusty figure

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
A little bit of a pouch

46
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,136
Was one of the most

47
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,440
Condescending egotistical of just

48
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
It says

49
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:10,048
So Justice Felix Frankfurter not the nicest guy but

50
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,328
Important

51
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:15,424
Presided over a ton of really important cases like for example

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,960
Brown V Board of Education

53
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:17,984
Big one

54
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,592
Being the slow March towards desegregating our school system

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,688
Any of the mystery today deals with his papers

56
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,040
These are the notes that you took while he was on the bench you know

57
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
Drafts of decisions that he wrote the Scentsy Road a memos back and forth with the other justices

58
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:43,072
Maybe the notes you took when they were all in that secret conference room that they go to when they're arguing

59
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:47,936
Got stuff to like people like us are like a man we got to get those paper

60
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,728
But in this case

61
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
There are no paper

62
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,056
Which brings us to

63
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,128
The story of one of the biggest

64
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
Heists

65
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,944
In Supreme Court history

66
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
The Vanishing

67
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,040
Of Justice Felix Frankfurter papers

68
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,832
From the Library of Congress

69
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
One day they were there

70
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
And then poof

71
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,024
Never seen people have been like Where What Where What Where are they what happened who took them

72
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,352
Harvard historian in New Yorker staff writer to Lepore

73
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,680
We may remember I was a big part of our guns episode we just released

74
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
She

75
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,056
Recently tried to get to the bottom of this paper caper

76
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,592
And more perfect

77
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
Producer Sean rameswaram

78
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,664
Talk to her about it

79
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,224
In such an ecosystem where

80
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,016
It's so hard to gain access

81
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,064
To these papers to these documents

82
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,880
At some point someone might try

83
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,928
To gain access to them

84
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
Unlawfully

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
Which

86
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:47,072
You once wrote a wonderful story about that I was hoping you could maybe

87
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,144
Retail and I I was thinking here we are telling stories

88
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,168
Maybe

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,264
Just imagine we're sitting by the fire

90
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
He can hear it

91
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,896
Crackle in the evenings crickets

92
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
Westfield

93
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,040
There it is there it is

94
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,160
So the largest heist in the history of the Library of Congress

95
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
I

96
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
Guarantee

97
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
You would not have guessed

98
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
If I do not have gas

99
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,351
That it was a papers of Felix Frankfurter

100
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,911
More than a thousand pages

101
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,239
A Frank for his papers were stolen from the Library of Congress

102
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:30,079
An early 1970s they have never been recovered.

103
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
Single page of them

104
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
It was a

105
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,455
Kind of extraordinary Heist

106
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:41,087
It was investigated by the FBI they had a prime suspect they can be know how there was a grand jury called

107
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,951
Extensive investigation involved the nation's leading journalist

108
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,303
Involve other members of the Court the nation's leading legal Scholars

109
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,375
We're questioned and were part of the investigation

110
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,911
The whole thing unravels

111
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
Days

112
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
Hours

113
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,799
Before the Saturday night Massacre and the

114
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,359
Explosion of Watergate

115
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,407
And was quickly forgotten

116
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:11,039
Does all of this this immense personality this historic figure

117
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:17,439
Did this plan to why it was his papers that were stolen or were they just the ones that were in the library the right time for

118
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,767
Someone to steal yeah I don't think we know that unless the

119
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,559
Mystery really solved

120
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,351
And I feel like I got so

121
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Close

122
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,703
What did you mean what what didn't you have to put it all together

123
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
Can you reveal that

124
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
I guess

125
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
We think about it

126
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,847
We're trying to solve a staff

127
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,919
You need to know the motive of the thief

128
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,503
And to know the mode of the thief you need to know what was stolen

129
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
But in frankfurters

130
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
Case

131
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,671
His papers and only really just got to the Library of Congress

132
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,767
So when the papers disappeared for a long time nobody even notices

133
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:59,679
I'm really proud of the nation probably have been letting people look at them because it's then you can start to reconstruct with Missy

134
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,287
What's clear from what was missing of these more than a thousand pages

135
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
Is that it was the best stuff

136
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:11,199
And so one theory that the FBI had early on was

137
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,247
I was trying to make money cuz you could like

138
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,063
All of it frankfurters corresponds with Lyndon Johnson

139
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
Princeton

140
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,671
Was missing as presidential signature

141
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:25,023
You could sell that I mean where you going to sell these things another question but like maybe that that's the case

142
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,607
The next theory that the library working with the FBI

143
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
So

144
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
It's a scholar

145
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
And a scholar who just

146
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
Cool

147
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,871
Mike wants to have this stuff

148
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,175
And doesn't want anybody else to

149
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,479
Like a fanatic like a collector

150
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
Lego yeah Lego just

151
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,063
You know sometimes when you

152
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,135
Will you work an iPod just for like a journalist you don't want to be scooped

153
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,719
Scholarship the same thing as an incredibly juicy

154
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743
Imagine

155
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,279
Reading frankfurters diary

156
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
And finds out

157
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
Okay

158
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
Frankfurter

159
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,775
God I slept with William Douglas his wife or something I don't know

160
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,615
Forever

161
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:17,247
You don't like something to treat me like I'm going to write a biography of Frankfort and this is how I'm going to sell it

162
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,575
The last thing you would want would be for another scholar

163
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:24,159
I have finding the archives all the time like

164
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
Shoot

165
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:29,023
They put it back in the box and you give back to the library and you know it someone else is going to call you

166
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
I'm never going to get

167
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,375
And you just got to forget about it cuz you

168
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,167
Imagines to call someone else

169
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,727
Maybe something like that like that you could imagine

170
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,799
A journalist if we can imagine

171
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,383
Are you just can't resist and it was new security

172
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
The library

173
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,503
I thought I interviewed everybody was investigated by the FBI

174
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,295
I need these Larry stars that like yeah

175
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,599
I have photo copy Xerox machine

176
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,391
Early xerox machine

177
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,463
And you'd like put a nickel in it but they would just let you take

178
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,743
Folders download

179
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:06,143
Down the hall and episode of stairs and through double doors and go to the bathroom at the back door of the bathroom and there was this one xerox machine

180
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,167
You can put a nickel in

181
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,983
And you just walked out the door with your folders

182
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,335
You can't do that. Anywhere

183
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,407
And it was this case it actually led to a cracked

184
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
So

185
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,991
The FBI quickly came to the

186
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
Conclusion that

187
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
Whoever

188
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:28,159
Had bothered to do the incredible labor of stealing all those paper

189
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,183
There's a lot of smoke

190
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,279
Women someone who both really wanted to write about Frankfurter

191
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
Had found something incredibly juicy

192
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,143
But had been forwarded

193
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Bye

194
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
The kind of

195
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
Cabal of Frankfurter

196
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:47,103
These people are called the hot dogs

197
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,807
They really are sitting by the campfire now it's on the hot dogs go on the

198
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
We've been

199
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
Sharpening of wooden stick

200
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
Star green wooden sticks

201
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,719
Now you put on the hot dogs and roast them

202
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,279
The hot dogs are the former Clerks of Frankfort

203
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
They are known as hot dogs and they loved him

204
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,679
Because like many an ornery person you know apparently was

205
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,727
Very stand-up person to work with

206
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,079
And they were so kind of protecting his legacy

207
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,943
Anyway so that the case is kind of just gets steamrolled by Watergate

208
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
But

209
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,807
This is kind of like the Alex Jones theory of the Felix rings

210
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,255
Diligent legal Scholars

211
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,071
Is this the story together

212
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,631
And I

213
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:46,239
It's a little conspiracy theory minded but it's not Beyond The Pale

214
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,311
So one of the pieces of paper that

215
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
Appears to have been missing from

216
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Frankfurters

217
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
Is really interesting

218
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,015
And was potentially quite damaging

219
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
To William

220
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
Brink

221
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
Who had been nominated to serve on the

222
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
And who's

223
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
Confirmation

224
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,767
Proceedings were happening right at the time

225
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
The frankfurters papers

226
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Rancho

227
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,399
What was controversial

228
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
4

229
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
Rehnquist

230
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215
Was

231
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,055
The issue that had forwarded Nixon's earlier

232
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
Judicial appointments

233
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
Which was his relationship

234
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Desegregation

235
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,711
Nixon who will recall

236
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,015
Pursuing the southern strategy trying to woo

237
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,807
White Southern Democrats

238
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:37,183
I nominated some potential justices who were segregation especially had been segregationist earlier

239
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:42,559
Frank was not but rank was served as a clerk for Robert Jackson in 1950s

240
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,887
And asked by Jackson to prepare a memo about Brown V board

241
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,191
Rent Pacific Mo on Richey Road

242
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,239
I realize it is an unpopular

243
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
A nun humanitarian position

244
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,847
For which I have been excoriated by liberal colleagues

245
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,407
But I think Plessy V Ferguson was right

246
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,503
I should be reaffirmed Plessy V Ferguson 1896

247
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,111
Decision legal principle of separate but equal

248
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,439
This is not Jim Crow legalize this is mentioned

249
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
And so it's probably

250
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,047
You know in Newsweek and didn't read the comics

251
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,119
Blue Savannah real big problem for wrinkles during his confirmation

252
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
Drink with work very hard

253
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,983
Too quiet that's

254
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
He said

255
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,567
I wasn't expressing my own views

256
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,127
I was asked to write a memo about

257
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
Justice Jackson's

258
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
Ann Jackson

259
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,551
Sakroots former secretary Elsie Douglas

260
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,087
She told reporters

261
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
That's just a lie

262
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,671
Mike Jenkins and ask his clerks to write

263
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,535
Down memos about what Jackson should think Jackson Hewitt he thought he has his Clerks

264
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
To tell him what they thought

265
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
So he could

266
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,911
Alli Breen if you could come to liberate on the most

267
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
Positions that they would present him with

268
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,031
So when was the send a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee tried to

269
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
Explain all of this

270
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,615
Senate Judiciary Committee threatens to hold

271
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,967
Hearings over the holiday or after Christmas is December of 1971

272
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,087
Nixon start putting pressure on senators

273
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,391
And you can imagine

274
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,439
Somebody at this point might have thought

275
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
I wonder

276
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:19,839
Was anything in frankfurters papers Witcher huge winter just been given to the recently given to the Library of Congress

277
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,887
The wood cast light on a ringquist nominee

278
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:29,567
And one of the things that is no longer in frankfurters papers but appears to have been before the law

279
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
What does theft

280
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,919
Is a letter that rank was wrote to Frankfurter in 1955

281
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
On the question of

282
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,295
Segregation in the memo to Jackson Western 1952

283
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:44,927
And there's two legal Scholars Brad Schneider and John Barrett who argue that

284
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,975
Bring Chris would have Revisited the arguments

285
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
They made and I can

286
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,303
52 in that letter to Frankfurter and it

287
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,703
Someone from the FBI or from the Nixon white house or on the White House plumbers

288
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:03,871
Could have been told by Nixon by hausermann by United is Jokers

289
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:09,759
Can you set up the gear I don't live in Congress and pull anything from ringquist from frankfurters papers but the Hydra tracks

290
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
Take a bunch of that crap out

291
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:16,927
We want to make it look like someone actually stole frankfurters papers like as if anybody can't you donate

292
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:23,327
My daddy was the whole thing was yet another Watergate cover-up he know we had another dirty trick

293
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
It's kind of a cool Siri isn't it

294
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
He did great that's great

295
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,215
Is that conspiracy theory also

296
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:34,079
To in your eyes those credible or do you do have an alternate theory of who may have taken them

297
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
Do you think it could have been just some nebbish

298
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,967
Academic core or biography

299
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
I do have a Siri

300
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,599
Termite evidence for that theory

301
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,647
I can't tell you that theory

302
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
And

303
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,791
In a theory we are disappointed to learn

304
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,839
That it is very unlikely that the paper still

305
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,655
The FBI had a prime suspect

306
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,215
Yahoo denied any involvement and

307
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:05,311
Did not accept an offer for kind of animosity in exchange for turning the papers

308
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
So although you know

309
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
They tended to believe that

310
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,967
That person probably had the papers

311
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
The FBI never made it

312
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
BFDI apps

313
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,551
We never made an arrest

314
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,087
An 8-day talk to a lot of people

315
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,647
They did they did take the investigation really Siri

316
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,951
But on the other hand

317
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,487
If the FBI had

318
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:29,887
Conducted the highest in the first place wouldn't their investigation have been just designed to cover up that they were the

319
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:36,287
Culprit would have to be thorough yeah right I mean you're not going to be like the Library of Congress calls in Frankfurt his papers and missing be like they were too busy

320
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
Because

321
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,639
That that would look very suspicious if they taking them

322
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,223
I love that. Anything fun Theory

323
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
Explains a lot

324
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,599
It's just very little evidence I'm just going to be completely clear

325
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:54,463
Evidence for what's a sheet of the timeline works out just a little bit like

326
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,071
You know the New York Times published a timeline of the kind of

327
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,631
Well this is the day that Donald Trump jr. net worth

328
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:08,287
Natalya and then this is the day that Wikileaks published the timeline lines of beautiful

329
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
But that is not enough

330
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
Coming up

331
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,135
Step back and ask how the world did this

332
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,695
How could this happen

333
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,535
Who gets to decide what happens to these court papers this

334
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
Betta fish

335
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,351
That's coming up

336
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,543
It's more perfect time Jedi will ride back to our conversation

337
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
With

338
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:46,943
Imperfect producer Sean rameswaram and Harvard historian and New Yorker staff writer Jill Lepore

339
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:53,599
So so what's the Supreme Court's official policy and all the papers that go to the Supreme Court what do they do with all that stuff

340
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,671
The Supreme Court's official policy is it is none of your business

341
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,767
It's very surprised myself was frankly surprised to discover this

342
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:05,631
That the national records act presidential records act legislation that

343
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,911
Protects

344
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Other

345
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
Papers

346
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
Of the federal government

347
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,311
Specifically excludes the Supreme Court

348
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:17,919
So what happens is completely up to the justices including most importantly

349
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
The discussions that the judges

350
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,503
Have

351
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
Conference

352
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,831
And their notes from those discussions and the

353
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,135
Papers at their clerks a symbol for them

354
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
I'm preparing how to

355
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,951
Consider a case or

356
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
Preparing

357
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,767
For a case that they decide

358
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Not to consider

359
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
It's completely the discretion of the just

360
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,167
Sweater to preserve that for the future for historians

361
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,239
For the public for that matter after journalists

362
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,055
They could destroy the land they often do

363
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:51,455
And how far back does the state he goes back to John Marshall he was one of the most important chief justice

364
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
This is

365
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,783
Marshall was an incredibly effective leader of the cord

366
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
But under his

367
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,623
Can you record gained an enormous amount of

368
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
But she really believed that

369
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
4

370
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
The justices

371
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
To be able to confer

372
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,327
With full candor

373
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,143
Their deliberations needed to be

374
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
Secret

375
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,191
In perpetuity

376
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,775
A lot of people that I'm opposed to Jefferson in particular that was completely inexcusable

377
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,359
Really important value in a republic is transparency

378
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,895
And Marshall was essentially mean

379
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,967
I mean that he loved the idea of the Mist

380
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,319
Courtney in the Mystique of the Core Music reserve of power

381
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
So

382
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:35,231
The tradition dates for Marshall and India are very strong arguments to be made in favor of the deliberations

383
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
Being kept secret I think

384
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
Certainly for

385
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,815
Period of time

386
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
But that we should never know

387
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,679
What was behind these decisions

388
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
Who's I think

389
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,519
From the Vantage of a historian

390
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,079
Athletic tape

391
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,711
Book from the political principle that they're strong and it's on the other side

392
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,783
The strong argument to be made that this is indefensible

393
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
First of all

394
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,343
They can decide to save nothing

395
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
They can burn that paper

396
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,695
New small number of them have indeed

397
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,743
Second they can

398
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
Decide they're going to

399
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
Give the papers to an R

400
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,887
Then they can give a tenant to a really inconvenient archive

401
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:18,495
What's 8 as a rule in this nine justices you want to meet you there

402
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,031
Conference notes

403
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,615
I see the paper folders that they assemble the papers about the

404
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
The case

405
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,711
You could very well have to go to mini farfan places which

406
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
Doesn't seem maybe that inconvenient

407
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,807
Maybe to your listeners but

408
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,671
Is it hard work being trained and getting enough money to even get to these places are

409
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,487
But these are the people who's in

410
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,023
Career has been spent

411
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,815
Pay by taxpayer

412
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Funds

413
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,863
To do the work

414
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
Of the federal government

415
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
Indeed

416
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,519
Portion of their papers that concerns the work they did for the federal government

417
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,079
A lot of people might say

418
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
Belongs to the public

419
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,687
My own view is it is indefensible that the court has no power

420
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,711
I'll see with her guard

421
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,015
2 Court related papers of its justices

422
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
Their rules people

423
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,135
These people can't set a rule for themselves, but I understand they don't want

424
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:11,487
Congress sitting rule about it that for them that falls under the separation of powers issue

425
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,303
But they should have the rule on the rule just shouldn't be

426
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
You can have your kids

427
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
Decide to burn off

428
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,167
What do you think it would take

429
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,727
For such a rule at this point to be passed

430
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,007
I would have thought

431
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
Honestly

432
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,079
They did might have come in the ass for math of the

433
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,615
Bush V Gore decision in two

434
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,919
When people might have said you know what

435
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,711
Supreme Court really powerful

436
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,759
In an era of judicial Supremacy

437
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,831
We actually need the Supreme Court to be saving

438
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,903
Papers because future Generations need to understand

439
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,719
By what means did those nine people

440
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Come to that

441
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,167
If you could steal

442
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,495
The papers of any Supreme Court Justice living or dead

443
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
Or Justino

444
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:01,919
Borrow for a weekend to pour over whose would you steal

445
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,551
I'm I'm going to just go for the gold here

446
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,831
John Marshall

447
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Classic

448
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,903
Yeah just be kind of original guy

449
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,207
He was Jefferson's cousin

450
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,743
He served on the bench with

451
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,559
Bushrod Washington George Washington's cousin

452
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,399
These guys were making momentous decisions early on

453
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:28,799
Madison V Marbury what did he ranked people into that who cares about me

454
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:35,199
I don't really want to really like when he's sleeping with the boarding house owner

455
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,759
Choice choice

456
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,807
I'm prepared to defend its second choice

457
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,087
Pills

458
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,463
More perfect Sean rameswaram speaking with historian Jill Lepore

459
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:52,095
Do you want to learn more about this definitely check out an article that she wrote in the New Yorker called the Great paper

460
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:57,215
By the way bushrod Washington was George Washington's nephew not Cousin but whatever

461
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:03,359
