WNYC Studio

00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:10,240
Leadership support for more perfect

Is provided by the Joyce Foundation

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,872
This is more perfect time Chad album Rod

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,944
So one of the big conversation sets

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,712
Just come out of

8
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,760
The Vegas mass shooting comes out of

9
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:22,528
Every

10
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,320
Unfortunately we are at

11
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,344
One a day here

12
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,416
It's like what is it

13
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,208
About America and guns

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,536
What is it that makes it so unique

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,328
When it comes to guns

16
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,120
Complicated question

17
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400
Different answers I'm sure

18
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,168
Part of it

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,192
The obvious

20
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,008
Is it we have these words baked

21
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,288
Into our founding

22
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,616
Today we're going to tell you

23
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,408
Really surprised

24
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,432
Story of how those work

25
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,504
But how we came to read them the weight

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,272
Do we do now

27
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,064
Producer

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,600
Shaun Robbins firm takes from here

29
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,160
I think we should start with one of the most

30
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:04,000
Confusing sentences in the constitution in the Bill of Rights not We the People

31
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,792
Not that one I got a different one

32
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,840
A well regulated militia

33
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:08,864
,

34
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,680
Being necessary to the security

35
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,216
Of a free state

36
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
,

37
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,032
The right of the people

38
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,824
Keep and bear arms

39
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592
,

40
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
Shall not being

41
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,736
Say one more time and do it do it with the comments

42
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,552
Sure a well regulated militia

43
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,136
, being necessary to the security

44
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,672
Of a free state

45
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,280
Oh, the right of the people to keep and bear arms

46
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,840
Totally unnecessary,

47
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,376
Shall not be in

48
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,936
Is that the one that's about guns

49
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,472
Adam Winkler who wrote the book

50
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,544
On the 2nd Amendment end of book is called gunfight he's a journal

51
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,360
He's a professor of law at UCLA

52
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:57,760
He said it's almost as a James Madison the author of the amendment I just discovered this wonderful new thing the, and why

53
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,552
Wanted to put it in there as many times

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,856
Which is like

55
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,904
Nrt professorial joke

56
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,952
But like seriously what is it in like

57
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:12,352
It has to be this one couldn't have been the amendment about like quartering soldiers in your house that was really confusing

58
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
They made like Jess

59
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,912
Indecipherable

60
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
And ever since

61
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,984
Generations of Americans have been confused

62
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
By the language of the Second Amendment

63
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,104
So when the singers written we had just fought this war with the British

64
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,896
This Revolutionary War

65
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,200
And they try to win it right from the get-go

66
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,992
Coming for our guns

67
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:32,576
So these new states are looking at this new federal government they're going

68
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,368
We don't know we want to trust you quite yet

69
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,904
So does the Second Amendment says

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
You guys can fight back

71
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,256
Like the feds aren't going to disarm you you can your malicious can keep you

72
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,280
Stats

73
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
I think we agree on

74
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,376
But then after that you just look at the sentence

75
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,680
That is not just a commas that are confusing

76
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,728
If you look at the sentence as a whole

77
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
Pieces don't seem to

78
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Get together

79
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,056
There's some noun

80
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
I mean

81
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,432
It's obvious that the sentence is about someone's right to bear arms but who

82
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,968
Who get that right

83
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
At the beginning of the sentence

84
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
You got a well regulated

85
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
Militia

86
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
Demolition

87
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
States have a right to form militias

88
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,160
What's to assemble

89
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,720
Groups of people and those people got to have their guns

90
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
That's easy enough

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,024
But then later in the sentence

92
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
There's, the right of the people to

93
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
To keep and bear arms

94
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,400
, shall not be infringed

95
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,424
The people

96
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
Which people

97
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
Those people over there in the militia

98
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
All people

99
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
If you mean all people

100
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
Why'd you say militia

101
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
It's like

102
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
The first quasi

103
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,480
The point of some sort of collective right to bear arms

104
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,272
And the second clause

105
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:39,904
Seems to point to some individual right to bear arms supposed to be a popularly ratified document

106
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,208
It's actually not that easy to read

107
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,792
And it's not it wasn't that easy to read then

108
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,608
This is Jill Lepore staff writer at the New Yorker magazine

109
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,912
She's also a professor of American history

110
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
I studied 18th century

111
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,568
I'm really trying to the 17th and 18th century American political story

112
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
And Jill says

113
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,712
From the beginning when people thought about the Second Amendment they tended to just focus

114
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,296
On the first part that the primary motivation for the amendment is

115
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,856
About militia well-regulated

116
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,624
Militia

117
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,416
But this confusing sentence was

118
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,952
Widely read as the

119
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,976
This Collective

120
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:21,375
Militia right not an individual one truth that the Second Amendment fact guarantees the right of a

121
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,959
An individual to bear arms and that the government federal government

122
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,983
In any fashion

123
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,287
Juices that just didn't exist

124
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,175
I disagree with the way you characterize that

125
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,319
Although what you said is stated in the media frequently the Stephen halbrook he's represented the NRA in several

126
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,647
Okay so I've written several books on Second Amendment issues

127
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,671
He actually thinks

128
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,463
Hey the sentence is just

129
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,535
Fine as is I don't think it's complicated at all

130
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:55,935
The framers were thinking about an individual right to bear arms 2nd Amendment refers to the right of the people to

131
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,543
First Amendment refers to the right of the people peaceably to assemble

132
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:06,175
I mean who is that it it's individuals are not some kind of collective that doesn't exist in reality

133
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455
So which

134
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
Which was it

135
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,527
That that's a really good question to add I mean

136
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,855
If it's complicated 1/2 what I can tell you is that

137
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,903
No people I spoke to for the story said

138
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
At least in the

139
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,975
20th century when the when the second amendment was

140
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,255
Taught in law schools

141
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
It was taught this

142
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
It was taught as a sort of

143
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
Antiquated

144
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,119
Outdated

145
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,679
Thing that has to do with malicious not so much

146
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Individual rights

147
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
But

148
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,823
Tulip or Stephen halbrook and their respective side something they can both agree on

149
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
Is that this

150
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,943
Super sacred Second Amendment the third rail

151
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
Of our American politics today

152
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
That just was not

153
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
I think

154
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:47,391
It was not like that it was utterly ignored ignored

155
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,951
This amendment When I Was An undergraduate

156
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,255
Undergrad at Florida State University

157
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,399
When did the Florida Supreme Court and start looking up law review articles on constitutional law issues and I found that

158
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,727
There was hardly anything written about the Second Amendment

159
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:06,079
Except for the third amendment the zoo there was no amendment that was less written about less

160
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
Legislated less

161
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,639
Activated

162
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,223
Lessa subject of Supreme Court conversation

163
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,319
And the Second Amendment this is not to say people didn't think about guns

164
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:21,183
People had guns States regulated guns but for most of our history the Second Amendment

165
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
It was like

166
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:28,607
Heavenly sword of the runt of the Bill of Rights literally like no one argued about it it's a striking thing to think about

167
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,167
There was no fight no fight how surprising that is

168
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,703
Is giving its centrality to our

169
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
Political compass

170
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
What is

171
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,799
Extraordinary transfer

172
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
Because there was this

173
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,639
Window of time where

174
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
All of this

175
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,455
Changes that the script

176
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
Just flip

177
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
There's two hundred years

178
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,807
Of everything being chill

179
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,599
And then suddenly

180
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
You got

181
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
This

182
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
I want say those fighting words

183
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
From my cold

184
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,751
So basically in

185
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,823
The Flash the Second Amendment goes from being

186
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,663
Ignored to being you

187
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,063
Supposed to be Radioactive

188
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,463
And in the process we start to read the thing totally differently all of a sudden this is hot

189
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,559
Leave the beta thing that's got nothing to do with that first part and everything

190
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
To do

191
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,631
What II

192
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,495
Nothing you can do folks

193
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
And me

194
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,871
What are the Second Amendment people maybe there is I don't know

195
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,431
And what I want to know is how did that happen

196
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,551
How do we start reading the Second Amendment the way we do now

197
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,135
And and what I found out is that

198
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,951
In the modern history of the gun rights movement

199
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,511
And how we read the second amendment can be boiled down to these

200
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,791
3

201
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
Totally

202
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,631
Unrelated disjointed seeming

203
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,191

00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,735
Tell me I'm wrong and finally

207
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,271
Number three

208
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
A reckoning

209
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,087
At the Supreme Court of the United

210
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,367
Unbelievable

211
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
What is that

212
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Cat sound

213
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
Can you imagine that

214
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,487
So you can tell me the story 3

215
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047

Chapter one

220
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
The Invasion

221
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,455

00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
Guns

226
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,279
I was an expert shot with guns or novice

227
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,351
12 years old I was raised a hunter and a fisherman

228
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,655
Besides being a carpenter and a builder

229
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:47,263
When I'm 12 years old my father buys me a high-powered rifle

230
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,799
How to memo

231
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,591
I can knock a elephant down with that

232
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,871
You said I'm getting at

233
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,455
Can I get you to tell me it's so we had to start at some point I have you tell me just

234
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,271
Your name and who are we are and who who who you are

235
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:07,231
My name is Bobby seale I created the Black Panther Party on the founding chairman and National organizer the black

236
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,279
Standing right now

237
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,071
Where Oakland California

238
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
The Black Panther

239
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:17,471
So this transition from the militia to the individual my right to bear arms

240
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
You could argue that

241
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,335
That whole individual gun rights movement started

242
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
In the 1960

243
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
Cities with the Black Panthers

244
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
In Oakland

245
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:31,295
It's an unlikely and got a surprise in origin for what's known as individual rights interpretation of the

246
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
Second Amendment

247
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855
Wewood different breed

248
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:40,255
I mean wheezing well-read guys we do I s*** we know I history just get some contacts as 1966

249
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
It's been

250
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,631
An exceptionally bad time for race relations all over the country

251
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,727
11 1500 people were in the

252
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,823
Attack dogs and hoses

253
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,223
And in particular major tension between

254
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:06,623
Black community and the police

255
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:12,767
The late 60s there were several high-profile incidents of Officer shooting unarmed black man

256
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
This is what was happening

257
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,095
You know and

258
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,679
What we did is that yet we took a position

259
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
October 1966

260
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,871
Barcelona spain Huey P Newton they start this organization called the Black Panther

261
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,919
Black Panther Party for self

262
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Defense

263
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,551
Fue Bobby's co-founder if he was 2 years in law school

264
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,391
You was going to the University of San Francisco School of Law

265
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
And

266
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,999
One day he's sitting there as as you do law school thinking about the law

267
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
Think about Malcolm X

268
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,815
Thinking about what you can do in Oakland

269
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
And it hits

270
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:51,167
The Second Amendment of the Constitution guarantees

271
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:55,007
The citizen's right to bear arms on public property

272
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
But they can argue

273
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,359
That the Second Amendment gave them a right

274
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
Have a gun

275
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:06,527
He said pass a constitutional Democratic civil human right

276
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
In those who

277
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,111
Claim that the second amendment protects an individual right

278
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,695
Right to bear arms says people who argued that were in the minority

279
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,487
They want taken too seriously

280
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:19,327
Play this is one of the first times that the individual rights reading was forced

281
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,631
Into the mainstream because

282
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,543
We have a right to bear arms we individuals then

283
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,871
We control the police observe the police

284
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,943
Tell him that we I see you talk about controlling police

285
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,551
What do eagles do you in law school so what legal status do we have

286
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,903
Second half of the Second Amendment right of the people to bear arms

287
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,767
Possessing bear arms okay he also pointed to a California state law

288
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,095
It said you could carry a gun as long as it wasn't concealed

289
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,655
If the gun is not concealed is not illegal

290
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,239
So the Black Panthers started policing the police

291
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
We did

292
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06,687
It would go out an armed patrols and follow police cars on 7th Street

293
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:13,087
West Oakland California a nightlife District a police officer

294
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
Sing from down the street

295
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
And the Crowds Are

296
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,303
The Gathering holding a gun

297
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
Can you see when it happened

298
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:29,471
What's a high standard going to cost 89 or $79 I bought the damn gun Isis here Huey

299
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,007
You got your shotgun now

300
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,847
White cop on one side of street arresting somebody

301
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,431
And the other side of the street you got a dozen black guys holding shock

302
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
Strictly for observation

303
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,039
Was standing in a line I had everybody standing in line

304
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,319
He told me

305
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
The moment the cop notice

306
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,903
Immediately stopped what he was doing with

307
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,183
The guy you pulled over

308
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,279
And walked over to them and said you have no right to observe me

309
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:59,679
And who is his no California state Supreme Court ruling states that every citizen has the right to stand and observe a police officer

310
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,007
Carry out the duties as long as it's not a reasonable distance away

311
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,031
A reason

312
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,567
Costumes 8 to 10 ft

313
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,615
What's an approximate 20 ft from you

314
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,919
Observe you whether you like it or not

315
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,247
He said man what kind of negroes are these

316
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,295
Let me see that gun no

317
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
You cannot touch my weapon

318
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,855
The cop says

319
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,927
Are you a Marxist and USA are you a fascist

320
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
Are you a Martian

321
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
Are you a fascist

322
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,047
Then the cops I asked you first

323
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,351
And you saying I asked you second

324
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,655
OU

325
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
I mean

326
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
It's like a standoff

327
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,311
And this is where the dominoes start to fall

328
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
Senate results

329
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,919
Diesel about the cops in Oakland are not happy and they

330
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
Family start

331
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,503
Running without the chain next thing we know

332
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
Got to protect

333
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
Society from nuts with guns

334
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,695
And I think we should act when we intend to act Mumford State Assembly representative Oakland

335
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
Just trying to put a bill in

336
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:01,631
Stuffed Black Panthers

337
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399

00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
And Bobby seale decides the Panthers

340
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,127
Be there for the debate and that they should take their gun

341
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:17,759
I took a delegation and armed delegation to the California state legislature May 2nd 1967

342
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
I have six women

343

00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
Are there races California legislature

371
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,447
Which is now considering legislation

372
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:45,055
And I keeping the black people just arms and Powerless at the very same time

373
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,615
Racist police agencies throughout the country

374
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,407
Intensifying the terror

375
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,479
Brutality murder and repression of black people

376
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
Etcetera

377
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:00,415
While he was reading that uniform Capital guards come running out grab Ronald Reagan

378
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:04,255
Took him in the opposite direction from us away from the kids

379
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
Okay

380
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,071
That's what we decided to go inside

381
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,911
Because the assembly was in session at the time

382
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
Next thing I know

383
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,727
We all loading

384
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007
13 elevator

385
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,311
Used shotgun rifles pointing up

386
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,591
Camera NX

387
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Crowded

388
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,407
Body touching body crowded

389
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,455
When they got off the elevator he asked him

390
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,503
Which way do The Spectator section

391
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,783
So the Panthers could

392
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,879
Watch the legislature debate the bill somebody says this way to the right

393
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,975
And so I walk into this door and as I walk into the door

394
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:41,631
The president pro temp in the State Assembly where on the actual floor of The Simpsons is not the guy

395
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
Goddamn spectator sex

396
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:50,335
I said come on get the hell out of here men win the wrong goddamn play sweetie walking to the state capital with Rashad Evans

397
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,991
Am I under arrest and then all hell breaks loose

398
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,831
Am I underweight

399
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,391
Am I

400
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,439
I turn around and I see

401
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:12,095
State Assembly NY State Assembly ducking down behind their deaths

402
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
Does government work

403
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703
Exercises

404
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
Is constitutional rights

405
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,055
I can point to this

406
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,079
Forgotten

407
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,615
Unknown moment

408
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,919
Here in the State Building in Sacramento

409
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
I've liked

410
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,223
The game changer

411
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,759
For the conversation

412
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
About guns

413
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
In America

414
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,599
Because suddenly

415
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:40,511
Overnight we were on the front pages of newspapers around the world who are

416
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:46,911
Ragtag organization with this International notoriety

417
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
Deuce to the world

418
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
You had a lot of people going

419
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,055
Wait what like there's a bunch of black man rolling around with guns

420
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,359
Walking into the Capitol Building when there's

421
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:59,711
Kids around what came of that that provide

422
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,271
The law said no one

423
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,087
Could carry a loaded weapon

424
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,391
Inside city limits

425
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:13,791
Within a hundred fifty feet of public property this was directed at the Black Panthers we know it was

426
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,375
The people have all kinds of opinions about the Black Panthers and what they did

427
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:21,471
Particularly after Huey Newton shooting happened at 5 a.m.

428
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:27,871
Later that same year was arrested for shooting and killing a cop marks the spot

429
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
Parole officer John Frey

430
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,943
Was found fatally wound

431
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,479
The case was eventually dismissed

432
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
But

433
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,855
What seems clear is that the Black Panthers decision to use the Second Amendment

434
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
On themselves

435
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,415
To show up armed

436
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,231
At the state capitol in California inspired

437
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,511
Vigorous backlash

438
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,703
FBI director J Edgar Hoover today asserted that the Black Panthers represent the greatest internal threat to the nation

439
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,263
Perkins thought a Revolution was about to Breakout

440
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,287
Right here at home

441
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:01,663
This led to a whole new wave of gun control laws in California but also

442
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,711
Federal gun-control nanny of witches

443
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
Seemed

444
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:10,879
To be targeted towards African-Americans rather than just reducing gun violence

445
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,439
We've got to get guns off the street

446
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,231
But the irony was

447
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,791
Even though those laws were designed

448
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,815
Disarm

449
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,375
Left-leaning black radicals

450
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,447
Many white rural conservatives

451
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,543
Thought that they were next

452
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,383
But government was going to take their guns next

453
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
Every action

454
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
Create a react

455
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,527
At the same time

456
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
Panthers thing is

457
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,135
Hitting front pages of newspapers around the world

458
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:47,999
You got assassinations you got race riots you got Vietnam protests

459
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,815
All of a sudden everyone's clamoring for gun control

460
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,583
Democrats

461
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
And Republican

462
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
In fact

463
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,447
No reason why out on the street

464
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,751
Civilian

465
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,287
Should be carrying a loaded weapon

466
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,103
Reagan that was the exact

467
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
Same day

468
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,455
At the Black Panthers showed up at state capitol in Sacramento

469
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
With a shotgun

470
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,503
Reagan

471
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,319
Gun control

472
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,111
What's Happening Here

473
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,159
Is the Black Panther show up in the capital

474
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
Sacramento

475
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,976
And Ronald Reagan react

476
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,512
They create some gun control

477
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:24,096
Then there's even more gun control even federal gun control

478
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,656
And a lot of people are sitting home watching this

479
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,192
And they start to get very

480
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:28,960
Upset

481
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,264
Which brings is to chapter 2

482
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
The revolt

483
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,176
You know we can't allow this to happen

484
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,248
I can buy the damn pistol that I wanted

485
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:45,600
These two guys John aquilino live in Rockport Texas

486
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,904
Joseph turow Buffalo New York

487
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,928
They get us there

488
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,744
And they've both been in the guns pretty much their entire life

489
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,792
My father was

490
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
Veteran

491
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
World War 1

492
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,632
Did some Recreation

493
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,656
Shooting with

494
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,984
My mother used to love to go to the amusement park

495
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,800
And spend all day shooting 22

496
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,384
Little things that moved in the shooting gallery but neither one of them

497
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,224
Totally hardcore about their gum police until around the time

498
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
The Black Panthers

499
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,368
The fact that here bunch of people who were

500
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
Slightly darker

501
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,464
Complected then New England

502
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,792
Ivy league grads running around with firearms

503
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,840
Did that scare people

504
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,864
Hell yes

505
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,936
Did it scare you didn't scare me I didn't

506
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:38,336
John told me Joe is well that it wasn't the Panthers themselves that was a problem I don't like anybody to tell

507
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:42,176
Tells me I can't do something it's all the gun control laws that came

508
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
In the wake

509
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,248
When the gun control Act

510
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
First pass

511
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,112
Today we begin to disarm the criminal

512
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
Caroline

513
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
And then say

514
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,488
A lot of things just appeared that I had been used

515
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,816
Joe said he starts the gun shops in his neighborhood close

516
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,400
Like the furniture store in Buffalo that used to have shotguns

517
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,448
$5 think they stop selling them

518
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,008
And he says that is really bothered him because

519
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,592
The reason you have a gun is for protection

520
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,640
It's like another form of insurance

521
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:17,248
Which wasn't an abstract idea for him buffalo in the 60s and 70s

522
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,552
Not the safest place in the world

523
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
His house

524
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600
Was even broken into

525
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,880
I could only

526
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,648
Describe

527
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,672
Home invasion

528
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,208
These guys actually

529
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
Better

530
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
Their way

531
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,280
2 Doors

532
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:33,120
Joseph seen his wife and his dog huddled in one room with a gun

533
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,424
Wally's two guys storm through his house

534
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,704
Andrada

535
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,496
I didn't take care of my wife

536
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,264
Purse

537
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
Some other money

538
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
And they are

539
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,152
I mean by the time the police got there

540
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,176
Devon

541
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:52,832
Joe's whole relationship with Firearms is there a predicated upon that this idea that is for self-defense and

542
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,856
Hear he's got

543
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,648
People breaking into his house

544
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
He's got

545
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:02,304
The cops not being there for him he's got the government trying to take his gun away so what do you do

546
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
You join

547
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,864
The end

548
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,400
Ra

549
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,192
Fight this gun control

550
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
But

551
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,056
This came at a moment where the NRA was at this

552
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,104
Crossroads unlike

553
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,896
Any edit seen before

554
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:17,920
Orson

555
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:24,064
Back when Joe joined in the early 70s the NRA

556
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,136
Was not the die-hard supporter of gun rights

557
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,416
Let me know today

558
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,208
Because according to Adam Winkler

559
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:34,048
It was never meant to be the idea behind the NRA

560
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
Continue

561
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,096
Fundamental right down to

562
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:41,984
Today was to increase Civilian Marksmanship training so that the next time there's a war Americans would be

563
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,008
Capable of fighting

564
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,824
You know you don't hear much about the NRA's founders

565
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:52,480
But the NRA was formed in the 1870s right after the Civil War by a reporter for the New York Times

566
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:59,392
Who thought that the Union Soldiers had been so ineffective in the Civil War because they were not familiar with

567
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,160
With firearms

568
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,440
Really yeah

569
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,488
But a hundred years their main focus was

570
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,560
Like teaching Boy Scouts how to shoot straight not

571
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
Second Amendment

572
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:11,424
And apparently if you go back through issues of American Rifleman

573
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,704
In the forties

574
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
50s

575
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,032
The Vietnamese version of Playboy guns inside a girl

576
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
You'll be amazed

577
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,128
That you can't find a single mention of the Second Amendment

578
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,664
Anywhere in those magazine

579
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,224
The NRA at that point was

580
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,528
Sort of like a gun trade group they work

581
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,320
Not super political and

582
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,880
And the people who ran it they were Hunters

583
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,904
Joan Hunter

584
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,744
They were just like these wealthy businessmen who like to hunt

585
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,048
According to John Rich guys who

586
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,584
They were hobbyist

587
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,376
But you had all these people coming in

588
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:46,240
Like Joe and like John who were convinced that guns weren't about

589
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,800
Shooting ducks they were about self-defense

590
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
Protecting yourself against criminals

591
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:55,456
In a time of starkly Rising crime rates this would lead to this straight up

592
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
Head on collision

593
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,016
At the NRA

594
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,320
Now

595
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,624
Joe and John join the NRA

596
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,696
The organization had just for the first time

597
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,488
Sort of set-up this lobbying

598
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,328
Yeah it was the brand new Institute for legislative action

599
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:15,168
John actually got hired to work there in 1976

600
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,984
And this true for legislative action

601
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,776
Supposed to fight for gun rights

602
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,824
Capitol Hill that's what they both wanted it

603
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
Today

604
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
Let's put it this way

605
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,408
We were the

606
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,968
If you would the bastard stepchildren of

607
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,504
The National Rifle Association

608
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,296
Really yeah

609
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,344
When the institute for legislative action

610
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,160
Was formed in 1975

611
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,184
The NRA

612
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,768
Refuse The Institute any Office Space

613
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
In the building

614
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,632
In the mid-seventies the part of the NRA that Lobby politicians

615
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,704
Had to rent office space from the hotel neck

616
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,520
Next door to the NRA is crazy

617
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,056
And then

618
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,616
Right after he was hired 78 people

619
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
Fire

620
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,200
Very interesting leaves big

621
00:26:59,456 --> 00:26:59,968
Firing

622
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,272
And then there was word

623
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,320
Did the NRA wanted to move

624
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,344
Weave washing

625
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,440
Selva headquarters there and moved Colorado Springs

626
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,720
What's in Colorado Springs

627
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,256
Olympic camp

628
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,328
They were going to move to headquarters and put it in here this

629
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,352
The Olympics

630
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:22,752
Sports training group so that they could then start writing all the magazines about all the Olympic sports

631
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,288
They really didn't know

632
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:29,664
They wanted to turn the NRA from organization of firearms owners

633
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,944
2

634
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,504
A Publishing Company

635
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,296
They wanted to get out of

636
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,064
The policy

637
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,648
The older Garden seem to have the stomach for whatever

638
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,976
Gunfight some members wanted to hat they were very moderate

639
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:49,376
They thought like maybe we should try and kind of get out of this hole gun business thing

640
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
Getting out

641
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,544
John says there's even a moment when a report surface that suggested we should change the name of the

642
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Association

643
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,640
Really yeah they were going to take rifle out

644
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,224
Tell me more tell me everything I say

645
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:10,368
Do you remember what any of those proposed names or no but they were considering at least taken rifle out

646
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
Oh yeah

647
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
Huh

648
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:15,232

So pissed off

651
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
And that's

652
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
When

653
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,400
The seeds of Revolt were planted

654
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,800
A few months later

655
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:30,848

Opening prayer

699
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528

Blah blah blah blah blah

702
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,136
And then

703
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
Little business

704
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,000
There are four

705
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
Microphone

706
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
Now is the time

707
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:35,520
When it came time for the members part of the meeting where members submit proposals which

708
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
It happened like this

709
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,592
Super parliamentary sorta way

710
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,384
This guy Neil Knox

711
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,664
He was part of their group

712
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,712
Any kind of bullrush the microphone

713
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,760
And he said

714
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,576
The Gather members have a list of bylaws

715
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,368
That they would like to have voted

716
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,648
Translation

717
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,696
Bugattis 15 demand

718
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,744
Restricting demands

719
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:02,400
Not sure if it's more or less than Martin Luther number one we demand that the NRA

720
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:07,008
Not moved its headquarters cancel that we demand The Institute for legislative action which

721
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,032
You want to kill

722
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,336
Should have more power through hell yes

723
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,616
Hell yeah

724
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,432
And we demand that the current NRA leadership

725
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,200
Be replaced

726
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,480
We wanted to take over

727
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:22,112
So the Federation guys making all these demands was crazy

728
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,648
Was that the

729
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,696
The leadership of the NRA

730
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,488
That was one of the meetings they just sat there

731
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,048
They they were like

732
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,840
Dumbfounded

733
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:37,728
But every time the Federation guy would make a motion judge border would say

734
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,520
Do I have a second

735
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,872
Okay the motion has been made

736
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,920
We start to speak for and against

737
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
Intermittent

738
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:51,552
The Federation members will use their walkie-talkies to coordinate who spoke at what microphone

739
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,344
How many votes did you need that day

740
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
I think this lease

741
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,160
600 volts

742
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:01,792
And how many votes did you think you had if you needed 600 so how many do you think if we hadn't the slightest I do

743
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,072
Going in

744
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,352
We

745
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
Debated

746
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,912
50/50 support

747
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:13,312
So as each of the 15 amendments are being debated the insurrectionists are running around in their orange caps with their walkie-talkies trying

748
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,128
That discussion debate

749
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,176
Lasted 8 hours

750
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,224
It went from 7 p.m.

751
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,504
Spotify

752
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,784
4 a.m.

753
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,808
And nobody love

754
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:27,648
They were all there

755
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,464
I mean we really didn't know whether to pull this off

756
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,280
But Joe says one of the big turning points

757
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,096
Is when a guy named Bob Kukla gets up to the mic

758
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,144
He was at the time the head

759
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,448
Of the institute for legislative action

760
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,496
To get into the mic and

761
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,032
He played it take

762
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,592
Remember to that takes right this was one that Bob

763
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:51,712
Cooper secretly recorded I don't know how he did it but what you hear on this tape is Bob Kukla

764
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:55,808
Talking to his bosses at the NRA and the yelling at him berating him

765
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,856
Or going to orbit

766
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,136
Time somebody talks

767
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,184
They're basically like

768
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
Bob

769
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
Shut up

770
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,072
They have the tape there any plated over the

771
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,608
And

772
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,912
Of course that electrified the audience

773
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,448
Do you could actually hear

774
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,472
People gas

775
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,008
The rank-and-file was

776
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,288
Audibly

777
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,336
This was this was evident

778
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,664
That the other side was going to deep six

779
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
Gun

780
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,224
Metro fights

781
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,040
People on the tape their own the room

782
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,600
Oh yeah there's still sitting next to him

783
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
The table

784
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,696
Over the course of this one 9-hour meeting

785
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
On a hot

786
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,560
Stinky night in Cincinnati every single one of those 50 proposals

787
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,328
Was Pat

788
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,144
We stopped the building in Colorado

789
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,704
Ensure the error I wouldn't change its name

790
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,544
Justify the leadership know just like the political savant

791
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,616
That figure that Hillary is going to get the presidency

792
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,152
They just

793
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,200
Absolutely took it in their shorts

794
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,272
And maybe the biggest change the most important change

795
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,040
Was that

796
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,600
The Institute for legislative action this

797
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,648
Political lobbying arm of the NRA

798
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,184
It was given the keys

799
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
To the car

800
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
They were not

801
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
The bastard

802
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,048
Stepchild anymore they

803
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:10,816
War

804
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:11,840
The NRA

805
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
You know what

806
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,656
We won and essentially

807
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
Staged

808
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,472
What are they called 1776

809
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,568
It's the same thing when the sun rose the very next day

810
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,664
DNR a whole new board

811
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,456
Committed to a new

812
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,248
No compromises view of the sea

813
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
Second Amendment

814
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,672
Individuals have a right not only to have a gun but to have almost any gun that they want and have as many of them

815
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
As they want

816
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,512
I can take those guns almost any place they want

817
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,048
American Gun politics

818
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,328
Literally change

819
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
Change overnight

820
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,400
I just shortly after this coup

821
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,424
The NRA

822
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
Both

823
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,496
This Abridged version of the Second Amendment

824
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,056
Right on the wall front center and its headquarter

825
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:56,640
The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed

826
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,920
Nice clean

827
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,968
Totally uncomplicated sentence

828
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:04,576
Conveniently left out was the part that talked about a well regulated militia

829
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,600
Be necessary for the

830
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
Security of a free

831
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,136
Restay

832
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
I asked John like

833
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,976
What about the militia part of the

834
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,376
Why doesn't the NRA ever talk about that okay babe now you get me back to asking you if

835
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,680
John I love you dearly

836
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
Trust me

837
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,728
But

838
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,312
It's only been in less what 30 years

839
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,616
That if you'll pardon the expression

840
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:31,712
The b******* media has turned the militia into a four-letter word

841
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,528
The militia is you and me Sean

842
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,672
Post-coup

843
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:44,000
The NRA took a very hard line on gun control

844
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:50,400
And became an irrepressible political force in America

845
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,680
Scare congressman

846
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:56,544
Lies in its ability to mobilize its members in any congressional district

847
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,592
At the touch of a computer button

848
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:02,432
They start pouring millions of dollars into lobbying and just

849
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,736
A few years after that Cincinnati revolt

850
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,784
The NRA endorses its first

851
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,064
Presidential candidate

852
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,880
The Constitution does not say

853
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,928
The government shall decree

854
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,976
The right to keep and bear arms

855
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:21,376
Reagan Reagan the Constitution says the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be

856
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,400
Be in French

857
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:28,800
At this point everyone and their Uncle leaves out the militia part of the Second Amendment

858
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,848
Which is why Americans eventually starts

859
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,872
Don't forget that

860
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,944
The militia clause or whatever you want to call it even exist

861
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,504
I wish I could save that instead of the last

862
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,112
Winter things that most surprised me when I was doing some research

863
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,392
This is Jill Lepore

864
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,720
By the 1990s the new interpretation of the Second Amendment

865
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,256
Had so penetrated

866
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,048
Popular opinion

867
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,632
That people were more familiar with the Second Amendment then with the first

868
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,656
1991

869
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
The First Amendment

870
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,520
That Eclipse really

871
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,288
Kind of shocks

872
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:06,688
But even if you did the Panthers and the president in the American people are all down to sort of forget about this militia

873
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,736
Clause of the 2nd Amendment

874
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,272
It didn't mean a lot without the

875
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,040
The courts

876
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,064
And of course

877
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,344
Particular

878
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,368
Supreme Court

879
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
Woodbine

880
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,464
Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court from 19

881
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,536
69 to 1986 lawrenceburger

882
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:25,120
I think you saw me giving a television interview and he says that this new interpretation is it

883
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,400
Second amendment was

884
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,936
The greatest pieces of

885
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:31,776
One of the greatest pieces of fraud I repeat the word fraud

886
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,080
On the American public

887
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,128
Do I have ever seen in my lifetime

888
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:41,248
And this was a republican appointed by Richard Nixon now

889
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
Yeah

890
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,904
Yeah so the Supreme Court obviously not dying to have this conversation at the moment

891
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,232
But it's not just the Supreme Court if you look at the federal courts the entire

892
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,000
Federal court

893
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,280
System in America

894
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,816
There is not one

895
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,096
In our history at this point

896
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,632
Over 200 years

897
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,424
Been a single instance

898
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,496
Of some gun law some State local gun law

899
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,336
Getting up to a court and the court going you know what you can't do this

900
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:09,152
It violates the second amendment that does not even happen

901
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:13,248
Really it would not even there wasn't I like an amendment Smackdown anywhere in federal court

902
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,040
This isn't this isn't a thing

903
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,600
Why didn't Supreme Court to weigh in on it

904
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:21,696
That doesn't even look like it could be a thing it doesn't even look like much more than a fantasy

905
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,976
Until

906
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,792
For gun owners there are few names.

907
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,072
To become synonymous

908
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
Getting our rights

909
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:31,424
Ladies and Gentlemen please welcome a true patriot

910
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,448
Dick Heller

911
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,056
Dick Heller showed up

912
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,592
Freedom

913
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,408
Twitter and changed everything

914
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,968
Well hello Freedom lovers everywhere out

915
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:50,368
Play R Kelly.

916
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,040
More perfect will continue in the MoMA

917
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:40,960
Heller in 2008 revise the Second Amendment or you could even say

918
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:47,360
Reeves life in the Second Amendment because the second

919
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:52,480
Had never been taken truly seriously by federal courts

920
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,016
Until 2008

921
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,416
Destiny Levinson professor at the University of Texas law school

922
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,720
This is my perfect time Chatham Rod here with

923
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,000
Sean rameswaram

924
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280
Price of Sean

925
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:09,120
Chad it's so I guess now it's time for chapter 3 to kill a right

926
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,400
You're going to get the dick

927
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
First

928
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,472
Here's what's going on in America

929
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,520
Amendment have become

930
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,824
One of those issues that can get you elected

931
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:22,176
Academics have begun to have a vigorous debate about its meaning

932
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,992
But the Supreme Court is still staying out of it

933
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,784
They're leaving this up to the states

934
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,856
Which already have all sorts of gun laws of their own to deal with

935
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,904
But then December 12

936
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:32,928
Mm

937
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:36,000
Republican George W Bush become president elect

938
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:39,584
After divided US Supreme Court has effectively halted

939
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,608
Florida's Contessa

940
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,680
Presidential vote tally

941
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:47,264
The NRA likes George W bush National Rifle

942
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,312
And he likes that

943
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,360
Protecting the Second Amendment

944
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
To the United States

945
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
Constitution

946
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:59,807
And in 2001 the Bush Administration declared that the Second Amendment protected an individual right to own

947
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:02,879
Guns UCLA law professor Adam Winkler again

948
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:05,951
Right that was not limited as most courts have held

949
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,231
The service in the militia

950
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:12,095
It almost right after he gets into office Bush's Attorney General John Ashcroft

951
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:16,959
Put out a letter this public letter to the NRA announcing that the Department of Justice

952
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,543
Adopted a new interpretation of the Second Amendment

953
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:24,895
And then right around the same time as the Bush Administration memo came out

954
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,943
Court in

955
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,711
Texas

956
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,735
Rule.

957
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,039
The Second Amendment did protect an individual right

958
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
Bear arms

959
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,831
And that was a

960
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,159
The big deal before this all the decisions and kind of

961
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:42,047
Beard in the other direction and because of that Court ruling and John Ashcroft letter

962
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,607
List three libertarian lawyers

963
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,143
Alan gura

964
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:50,495
Constitutional attorney Bob Levy a chair the board at the Cato Institute

965
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:56,639
Clark neily thought the timing was right we thought it was a good time for some litigation

966
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:59,967
And one thing you need to know about these guys is that they weren't necessarily doing it

967
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:04,319
The guns they had no association with the NRA or the gun rights movement

968
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,343
Then it was

969
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,719
More about getting the government to back off in our country when the government wants to restrict our Liberty

970
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:16,351
It isn't coming on the government to make the case for it as income in the government to say here's why you shouldn't be permitted

971
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,655
To exercise that right so that was their rank

972
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,471
I've always wondered why the gun rights movement has

973
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,287
Becomes a proxy war for like anti-government

974
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,359
Is Mmm Yeah well I mean if you think about it

975
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,895
The something professor

976
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,687
Sandy Levinson told me

977
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,455
Is that

978
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,759
Embedded in this amendment

979
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:38,111
Is the very idea that you can take up arms

980
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,647
Against the government

981
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,183
To protect yourself

982
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:44,255
And your fellow man from tyranny on the far right

983
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,071
Or occasionally on the far left

984
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,631
You find people who are willing

985
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
2

986
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,191
Say this that this is really what

987
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
Terrific

988
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,239
The Second Amendment

989
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:58,079
But mainstream conservatives in mainstream liberals

990
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,359
Arnott

991
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:03,199
Very happy with those arguments they are embarrassed by them

992
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,271
And so mainstream conservatives

993
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,295
Want to talk

994
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,343
About self defense against

995
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,623
Burglars

996
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,183
And mainstream liberals

997
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,463
Want to talk

998
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,487
About

999
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,511
How

1000
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:20,351
The second amendment protects State organized militias

1001
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,911
And almost nothing else

1002
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:28,031
Hey we're getting back to the story these three libertarian lawyers they decide

1003
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,055
Put together case

1004
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,847
And their idea was to Target this

1005
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,639
Really restrictive gun law

1006
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,407
NDC

1007
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:39,807
All handguns were banned you could own a shotgun or rifle but the law specifically made it illegal to ever put a round in the chamber

1008
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,599
Even in self-defense or there was

1009
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,159
There's really funky we described it as a

1010
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,951
Ban on all functional firearms

1011
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:49,535
But in order to challenge that law they needed to find a plaintiff

1012
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559
Interesting how do you

1013
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,583
Find a plane

1014
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,375
You look for somebody who

1015
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,911
Got robbed what do you do

1016
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,959
Well we can actually instigate

1017
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,007
Litigation and we can take out a

1018
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:05,407
Full page ad in the New York Times saying you want to vindicate your second amendment rights give us a ring Bridge of central got the word out talk to

1019
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,711
I would say between

1020
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,991
2 and 3 dozen

1021
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:13,599
People they all had really interesting stories they found a guy who was

1022
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:19,999
Gay gentleman named Tom Palmer previously been assaulted when he lived in California because he

1023
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:23,071
He was gay was almost murdered by a skinhead mahbuba phobic

1024
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,607
Subs and he wanted to go

1025
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:29,471
To protect himself. Our lead plaintiff was an African American women named Shelly Parker

1026
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,519
She was trying to protect yourself against

1027
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:35,359
Local drug dealers and the cops actually told her she should get a gun

1028
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,639
Which was a legal

1029
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:41,759
Weird so they have this whole group so we ended up with three men and three women the 20s

1030
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:45,343
2D early 60s formal way to America America

1031
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,391
And the problem they ran into

1032
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:50,463
Was that all these super sympathetic plaintiff

1033
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,255
Didn't have the Sperrys

1034
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,535
Special thing they needed

1035
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,559
To bring a case

1036
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,327
Standing

1037
00:45:55,583 --> 00:46:01,727
Standing with your sister legal term meaning they didn't have a sufficient grievance to be in court like if you can bring a case you have to show that you

1038
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,007
Cuban actually harmed

1039
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,031
Bye

1040
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:08,127
Not being able to get a gun you have to show some physical concrete proof

1041
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,407
The harm has been done

1042
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,431
But you've been

1043
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,455
Denied a gun

1044
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,247
And none of the plaintiffs had the

1045
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,159
Except for one.

1046
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,183
Dick

1047
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,743
That's me

1048
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,791
Good to meet you and you

1049
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,095
Dick help

1050
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,631
John this is my favorite hat

1051
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,423
Make America

1052
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,751
Free again actually gets paid by the Frida

1053
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,799
With a big

1054
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,591
Western handgun in the center

1055
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,663
It looks like you drew a trigger out there that what you did

1056
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,711
Well it was missing a trigger so

1057
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,503
We had to update it

1058
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,527
Who's we

1059
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
Okay

1060
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,623
Where's the Supreme Court

1061
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,439
The building where he became famous he's

1062
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:56,255
Swim seventy five year old white guy

1063
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,583
Sports classes that look straight out of the 70s

1064
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,887
You got a situation here you want to cross

1065
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,447
Sure what's the situation

1066
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:10,847
The anti Trump protesters are here actually happened to meet him in DC today after Trump won

1067
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,151
The election apparently

1068
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:19,807
President-elect is visiting the White House there were protesters everywhere

1069
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:23,135
Notmypresident there anti Trump protesters

1070
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:25,439
Don't you like freedom

1071
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:30,559
What about freedom

1072
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,631
What about freedom

1073
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,471
Most of the protesters are passing us wear white but

1074
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
Chest

1075
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,823
A few young black men pacify

1076
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,103
He says

1077
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,407
See you on the plantation

1078
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,247
Freedom

1079
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,599
See you on the plantation

1080
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
Yeah

1081
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,159
I just say that

1082
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:00,255
We in Washington we call it the government Plantation

1083
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,535
You didn't mean

1084
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:06,143
You kids are about to be slaves or something cuz that's how I interpreted it

1085
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:11,263
The more power government has the less Freedom you have the closer you get the ball and chain

1086
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,055
Other Plantation

1087
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,639
This pretty good place to eat right there

1088
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,943
If you here for a couple of days if you've been in there

1089
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,967
I have not

1090
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
Yeah pretty good

1091
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:24,575
Okay Hyatt Regency this is good for you we can do this to

1092
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:29,695
We need to talk about Hyatt which is just down the street from Supreme Court and

1093
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,511
And explain to me that his journey with guns

1094
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,559
Like John and Joe

1095
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,095
Began pretty casually

1096
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,631
Flight 1976

1097
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,423
Is living in DC

1098
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,983
And one day he's sitting at home

1099
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,263
I was watching

1100
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,823
My hero Matt Dillon

1101
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,103
Gunsmoke

1102
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,687
Different Matt Dillon

1103
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:55,039
And he had this long-barreled handgun

1104
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,623
I was about 30 years old

1105
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,159
And I figured ghali

1106
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:03,487
I should own my first gun so when I went and bought

1107
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:06,047
My what I call my Matt Dillon special

1108
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:09,887
Hi standard 22 revolver Matt Dillon Buntline

1109
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,423
And it was just

00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,959
I live in America

1111
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,495
We're Cowboys Society

1112
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,543
I should have a cowboy gun and weave

1113
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,127
Nothing no really deep thought to it

1114
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:23,711
But then just a few months after he got that gun in Ark

1115
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,759
October 1976

1116
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,807
A trend that started with the Mulford Act

1117
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,111
And the Black Panthers back in Sacramento

1118
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:34,719
Hits Washington DC DC gun control regulations outlawed

1119
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:40,607
Firearms ownership get that gun law which outlawed all hang out so I had some choices

1120
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,375
I could

1121
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,911
Turn it into the government

1122
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,191
Not going to happen

1123
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,495
I can throw it in the Dipsy dumpster

1124
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,775
Not going to happen

1125
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,311
Or

1126
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,615
There was another option I could go to jail

1127
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:55,455
Not going to happen eventually he decides on option D

1128
00:49:55,967 --> 00:50:00,319
Give the gun to his brother my brother lived in Maryland so that made it very convenient

1129
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:03,135
Did you just go visit your gun in Maryland what are you

1130
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,927
I yes I would go visit

1131
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,975
And caress and use my gun

1132
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
What did you use it for

1133
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,303
Target practice of course

1134
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,095
Take me to

1135
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:15,167
Gun visitation situation sound functional but

1136
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:21,823
I think like any long-distance relationship they mostly sucked because more and more he didn't feel safe where he lived

1137
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,919
About 10 blocks from the Capitol building right across the street from

1138
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,479
The number one most infamous

1139
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,807
Drug dealer Den in the city

1140
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,599
Cold Kentucky courts

1141
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,647
Every night at 2 a.m.

1142
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:39,743
The chief drug dealer would fire a 9 mm

1143
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,791
Into the air empty the clip

1144
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,327
And that was the signal

1145
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,119
Every night at 2

1146
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,911
Drug dealing was over

1147
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,679
For the day

1148
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:53,055
It's clear that living through the crack epidemic in DC really

1149
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,615
Shaped a lot of dicks views on guns

1150
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
So

1151
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,015
In the years after the handgun ban

1152
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:08,159
Dick starts the very long process of finding a way to get his gun back to DC and he eventually even quits his desk job

1153
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,975
To pursue getting his gun back full time

1154
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,767
I'm all over Capitol Hill

1155
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,047
And I see

1156
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,119
Security guards have guns

1157
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,655
Well

1158
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,191
Going

1159
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,495
Why can't I be a security guard

1160
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:23,775
Golly

1161
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,823
Maybe that would help me

1162
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,847
Have a gun

1163
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,639
But I can't have on my own

1164
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:32,479
Let's see how easy or not easy this is

1165
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:33,759
Dali

1166
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:34,783
One step

1167
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,319
Leads to another

1168
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,343
Just like that

1169
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:41,183
Dick was able to have a gun in DC but only during the day

1170
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,719
And only while he was working

1171
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,999
Like Barney Fife

1172
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:47,583
At the end of my shift I have to turn in my gun and my bullets

1173
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,119
And they kept it there

1174
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,655
And they kept it on site in the sea

1175
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,215
You finally starts looking for some help

1176
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,239
Illegal

1177
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:57,823
I knew Washington cuz I lived here and I'd gone to something tank

1178
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,359
Cato and Heritage

1179
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:03,455
Some others I knew they existed out there looking for some help

1180
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,527
Turns out these lawyers are out there looking for some dick

1181
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,343
No no

1182
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,415
Wasn't there ideal sympathetic guy

1183
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,231
I was told repeatedly and it was in print

1184
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,511
But I was the worst

1185
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,303
Choice less-than-optimal

1186
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,119
Because of that Plantation thing you said or

1187
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,423
He was always talk smack about

1188
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,959
Federal government and interviews

1189
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:30,591
One day Clark neily put a note in my hand and said dick Heller this is what you say

1190
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,383
I just wanted a gun

1191
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,175
To protect my house

1192
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,455
Shut up

1193
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,527
Play it wasn't their favorite plaintiff

1194
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,599
But the one thing that no one else has done

1195
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,391
Which is besides just wanting

1196
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,975
An illegal handgun in DC he actually fill out an apple

1197
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,743
Occasion

1198
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:51,327
To register a gun that you already possess a gun in Virginia

1199
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:55,679
And had that application denied and he had this denial slip or whatever it's called

1200
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,727
You like literally had this physical proof

1201
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,775
All of his grievance

1202
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:04,895
And simple technical arbitrary little stupid piece of paper gave him

1203
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:11,295
What's known as standing to bring the case stick Heller ended up being kind of Last Man Standing that was nothing to do with that was not our

1204
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,319
Choice regardless

1205
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:16,927
Became their guy and these three lawyers they take the case of the DC Court

1206
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,951
And the judge

1207
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,231
After

1208
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:22,303
Inspecting it said the case can go forward

1209
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,863
Magic Moment

1210
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:44,319
The Supreme Court is entering the debate over the Second Amendment right to bear arms

1211
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:50,207
Today's cases roster huge interest among citizens and politicians alike and it is divided even the president

1212
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,487
And vice president

1213
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,559
Chapter 3

1214
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,863
The Reckoning March 18th

1215
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,399
2008

1216
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,703
The day the Heller case was argued

1217
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,495
Supreme Court everyone under

1218
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,543
Do it how high the stakes were

1219
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:11,711
Outside in front of the Supreme Court protesters by the hundreds were marching and

1220
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,783
Panting

1221
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,063
Favor of gun rights

1222
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,111
And in favor of gun control

1223
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:24,511
Journalists from all over the world to send it upon the supreme court that day

1224
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,071
An inside the Supreme Court House

1225
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,375
Not a creature was stirring not even a mouse

1226
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:32,191
You could have heard a mouse I say

1227
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,471
And

1228
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,007
Everybody is just

1229
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:35,775
Quiet

1230
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,335
And you can hear your heart beating

1231
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,127
And suddenly

1232
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,407
Bam

1233
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:45,247
And then Oye Oye Oye

1234
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:48,063
The clerk yelled at the top of his lungs

1235
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,111
And then there's a strange sound

1236
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,415
What can that be

1237
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,207
It was the swishing

1238
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:58,303
Of the Robes of the justices as they ascended the steps

1239
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,327
To the bench

1240
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,143
Unbelievable

1241
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:09,311
We will hear argument today in case General 7 290 District of Columbia vs. Heller

1242
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:13,407
History of the Supreme Court with directly try to figure out what the Second Amendment mean

1243
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,943
Dellinger

1244
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,223
Immediately

1245
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,783
Good morning mister chief justice to me please the court

1246
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,343
DC lawyer Walter Dellinger github

1247
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:24,415
And jumps right into it

1248
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,975
Essential question

1249
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:31,839
What was James Madison thinking when he wrote the super confusing sentence like 200 years ago was he

1250
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:37,215
Thinking about the individual people and the right to own a gun or was he thinking about the collective right

1251
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,263
Of the militia

1252
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,567
The first text to consider

1253
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,639
Is the phrase protecting a right to

1254
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,919
Keep and bear

1255
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:53,087
If you look at the phrase the phrase keep and bear arms how it was used at the time

1256
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:53,855
Bear arms

1257
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,415
Used to refer to the use of arms

1258
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:59,231
In connection with militia service

1259
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:04,095
Madison's rough drafts of the Second Amendment it's pretty clear that

1260
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:04,863
When he says

1261
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,911
People have a right to bear arms

1262
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,703
All he really means is

1263
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:11,007
Report for Duty

1264
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:11,775
The language

1265
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:16,639
Keeping and bearing arms when was first called confirmed

1266
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,199
That's a right

1267
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:24,575
It's a mystery

1268
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,367
Why would they say the right of the people

1269
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:30,207
To keep arms just the people in the state militias

1270
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,767
Why wouldn't they stay state militias have the right

1271
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,535
Dickey Farms

1272
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:36,607
Listen to Justice I believe that the phrase

1273
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:39,167
The people and the phrase the militia

1274
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,471
We're really in sync with each other

1275
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,263
The Federalist farmer uses

1276
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,567
The phrase the people are the militia

1277
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,223
Includes all the people

1278
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,015
Yes I do believe it includes

1279
00:56:54,783 --> 00:57:00,159
At this point everyone jumps in a bunch of just start interrupting each other

1280
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:06,559
Metallica scrum and they're all trying to figure out okay so when Madison was afraid

1281
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,583
Not being friends

1282
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:10,911
Who were the people he was talking about

1283
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:17,567
What those words meant was the people just the militia or everyone all the people what is the

1284
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:21,919
Relationship between the second part of the sentence the people part and the first part of the sentence

1285
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:28,319
The militia part Verdugo rokita

1286
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:34,719
Highlander Scottish Highlanders for some reason

1287
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:39,583
They even tore the starter diagram Madison sentence

1288
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143
In the net result

1289
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,679
According to Adam Winkler

1290
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,447
Was

1291
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,471
For liberals

1292
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:48,031
Steven souter retire Ginsburg

1293
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:51,359
Seem to want to emphasize the militia part of the sentence

1294
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:58,015
Avenue had the four conservative justices Scalia Thomas Alito Roberts who seem to want to emphasize the people party

1295
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:01,087
I don't see how there's any any

1296
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,367
Any

1297
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,391
Contradiction

1298
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,951
Auntie people's team captain the quarterback

1299
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,999
The first chair that day was

1300
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,279
Without a doubt

1301
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,815
Justice Antonin

1302
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,119
Scalia why isn't it

1303
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:13,887
Perfectly

1304
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,655
Plausible

1305
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,935
Indeed

1306
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:21,055
To assume that since the framers knew that the

1307
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,199
Justice Scalia

1308
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,223
Of course was

1309
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:34,879
Very conservative Justice grew up in Queens long time reporter covering the Supreme Court

1310
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:40,255
She's also written a biography of Justice Scalia he was an avid Hunter and he grew up at a time when

1311
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:46,655
Young men were trained in firearms in high school auction

1312
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:50,495
Even from the time he was a kid at school and queens he said he used to

1313
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,519
Carrie is gone

1314
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,823
For rifle practice at school

1315
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,615
On the Subways of New York

1316
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:58,943
Can you imagine doing that today in New York City

1317
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,991
You're being unrealistic

1318
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,271
Chicken thinking that II

1319
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,063
Santa Claus is not broader than the

1320
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,391
The principal purpose here is the militia

1321
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,671
The second clause

1322
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:14,047
To keep and bear arms

1323
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:20,703
It's going to be throughout the arguments is that Scalia is very very

1324
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:23,775
Forward Lee pressing the sort of individual rights

1325
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:27,359
Argan speaks of the right of the people and just like David souter

1326
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,919
Are arguing back sing

1327
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,711
What are the collected the militia

1328
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:36,831
This goes on for well over an hour the justices for grilling lawyers

1329
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:39,647
Arguing amongst themselves everybody trying to figure out

1330
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:41,439
What was in James Madison's head

1331
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,743
Until finally

1332
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,767
Justice Breyer

1333
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:47,583
One of the Liberals

1334
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,887
She's on the phone

1335
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:52,191
Myquest forget what Madison intended

1336
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,983
There is no way for us to know

1337
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,263
Let's talk about now

1338
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,055
Let's talk about gun violence

1339
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,335
Descendants was most

1340
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,383
Definitely written about muskets

1341
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,919
What about handguns

1342
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:02,943
An assault rifles

1343
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,735
What is reasonable

1344
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,015
Now

1345
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,551
80 to a hundred thousand

1346
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,831
Some people every year

1347
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,855
In the United States

1348
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,647
Or either killed

1349
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,695
In

1350
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,719
Gun-related

1351
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:15,743
Homicide

1352
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:16,767
Or

1353
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:17,535
Crimes

1354
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,327
Active

1355
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:20,863
Or suicide

1356
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,631
Suicide

1357
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,935
That's why I say 8100

1358
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:26,495
Now in light of that

1359
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,055
Why isn't

1360
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,335
A ban on handgun

1361
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,383
Reasonable

1362
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,431
Or a proportion

1363
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,455
Respond

1364
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:37,247
On behalf

1365
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,271
Alpha District

1366
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:42,623
Because you are for the same reason I was offered by

1367
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,415
Numerous military office

1368
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,695
At the highest level

1369
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:48,767
Of the US military all branches of service

1370
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,047
Writing to

1371
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,119
They agree with us at the handgun ban

1372
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:55,935
Search the week in America's military preparedness

1373
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,727
Alegria basically argues

1374
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,263
When you take away people's guns

1375
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:01,055
They're going to be less prepared

1376
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,359
If and when they enlist in the army

1377
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:05,151
To which Justice Breyer's like

1378
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:09,759
They cancel practice shooting rifles banned in DC

1379
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:12,063
They can go to gun ranges I guess the neighbors

1380
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:16,415
What does that make it unreason

1381
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,439
People first

1382
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,255
With a very high crime rate

1383
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,303
Assuming

1384
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,119
If the objective is what the military people say

1385
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,655
To keep us ready for the draft

1386
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,423
If necessary

1387
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,959
Is it on

1388
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,983
Simple Forest City

1389
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,007
Without height

1390
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,055
Just say no

1391
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,079
Handguns

1392
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:34,847
Here

1393
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,991
Well you want to say yes that is correct but I want to hear

1394
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:41,759
What

1395
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:46,111
What is a big crime problem I'm simply getting you to focus

1396
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:50,207
Stop by the way it was Justice Scalia telling Alan gura

1397
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,487
How to answer just a

1398
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,511
Does Breyers question

1399
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,047
The answer is yes Justice

1400
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:59,423
And actually feels any standard of review that might be offered under Section

1401
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,447
Instructions

1402
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:06,079
The oral arguments last 90s

1403
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,103
7 minutes

1404
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,895
Far longer than most other cases

1405
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,687
And going into the arguments

1406
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,479
Many Supreme Court Watchers

1407
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,527
Figured the case would be a close

1408
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,807
5-4 decision

1409
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,343
And it could go either way

1410
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,879
And as with

1411
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,927
All of these clothes cases

1412
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,975
Question was what would Anthony Kennedy

1413
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,999
The swing Justice

1414
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:24,767
Do

1415
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,839
As in so many issues in America

1416
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,655
Comes down to what does Anthony Kennedy believe

1417
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:37,311
So at the oral argument and I had the Good Fortune to be at the oral argument in the Heller case

1418
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,103
Everyone was looking

1419
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,663
To hear what would he say about the Second Amendment

1420
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:45,759
His was really the vote that counted in the very first comment he made

1421
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:52,415
Remote set learn to defend

1422
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:55,231
Himself and his family against hostile Indian tribes

1423
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,511
Outlaws

1424
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,815
Wolves and bears and grizzly something like that

1425
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,631
One of the first things he said was

1426
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,655
About bears

1427
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,215
Bear arms but

1428
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:05,983
Grizzly bears

1429
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,311
The Pointe candy was trying to make with clear

1430
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:14,431
Don't you think the framers had other reasons that they wanted people to have guns

1431
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:16,479
Other than just being a militia

1432
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:17,759
What about

1433
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,039
People being in their homes

1434
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,831
And is meeting to defend

1435
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,159
And that's when I silently

1436
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:28,767
Scream at the top of my lungs so nobody could hear me yes we win

1437
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,303
...

1438
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,327
Something

1439
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:51,551
Will you turn out to be historic Supreme Court decision handed down this morning

1440
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:55,135
07 to 90 District of Columbia vs. Heller

1441
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:02,815
We hold that the second amendment guarantees an individual right to have

1442
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:07,679
And that the district's handgun ban as well as its requirement to firearms in the home

1443
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,215
Be rendered inoperative

1444
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,239
Violate

1445
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,263
It was

1446
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:14,591
A groundbreaking reading of the Second Amendment

1447
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:20,991
Scalia minimize that Clause referring to

1448
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:26,367
A well regulated militia and put the stress on the second Clause that refer to the right of the people

1449
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,159
The people will not be deprived of

1450
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,439
The right to keep and bear arms

1451
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,743
This was Edgar zakat for him

1452
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:32,511
On the bench

1453
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,535
I think so

1454
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:38,143
Rip the militia Clause December 15th 1791

1455
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:40,447
The June 26 2008

1456
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,495
A pretty good run if I'm being honest

1457
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:47,103
For the first time in the history of these United States

1458
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:49,407
The courts definitively declared

1459
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,687
That the Second Amendment

1460
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:52,479
Give every American

1461
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:58,879
The right to a gun for self-defense it was it was a great day for freedom in America was a great day for the Constitution

1462
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,415
Great day for citizens

1463
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:04,511
It's a great day for gun owners it was great day for fearful people

1464
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:06,815
Of course

1465
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,095
Not everyone agreed

1466
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,887
I mean to me that's a travesty

1467
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,703
This is Jack Rico

1468
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:16,287
Professor of history and political science at Stanford University

1469
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:18,079
He filed a brief for the court and

1470
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,895
He said scalia's reading of the history is just

1471
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,663
Wrong

1472
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:26,271
The Second Amendment is not about individual right that we shouldn't even be talking

1473
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039
About history

1474
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:32,927
Because the nature of firearms has changed so radically for the 18th century to our own time and that ultimately

1475
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:38,303
And here you go just as Stevens in his descent the court has decided to end

1476
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,583
Political Thicket

1477
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,863
Southern-style politics

1478
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,399
To be honest

1479
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:45,983
Let Me Ride That really believe in constitutional law anymore

1480
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,287
I think I social laws of fiction

1481
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:51,103
Pedro has become so highly politicized

1482
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:53,151
In so many areas

1483
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,199
I think I socialize

1484
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:55,967
Is bunk

1485
01:05:56,223 --> 01:06:00,063
Wow I just destroyed I'm not a lawyer so that I don't have any professional steak

1486
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,111
Interfering the Judiciary

1487
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,183
But

1488
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,975
There's a very big

1489
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:12,095
But he did have a major caveat section of our opinion points out that like most rights

1490
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,375
What's the Second Amendment right

1491
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,399
Unlimited

1492
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,191
He said like all right

1493
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:22,079
It's not absolutely the right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever

1494
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,359
And for whatever purpose

1495
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:27,455
Which is very important to keep in mind

1496
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,503
Long-standing

1497
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,039
Possession of firearm

1498
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:32,831
Mentally ill

1499
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:35,391
Or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms

1500
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,415
Sesame Place

1501
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:40,767
This is another thing that we tend to forget

1502
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,047
The decision says

1503
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:44,351
Every individual has the right to bear arms

1504
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,911
The most interesting lie like the decision also says

1505
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:49,471
Of course we need gun control

1506
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,775
The word Heller

1507
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,311
Come to represent

1508
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,335
Like

1509
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,871
2nd Amendment rights

1510
01:06:56,383 --> 01:07:00,479
Are you against Heller even though being for Heller

1511
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,271
Is being for gun control

1512
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,575
Fusing yeah it is

1513
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,647
I mean after all this time it's still just

1514
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,927
Totally confused

1515
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,975
You have a right to a gun

1516
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,023
But the government has a right to regulate it

1517
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,839
Decal gets his gun back in DC

1518
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:19,679
But PC still also has all sorts of gun regulation

1519
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:23,775
You see the same pattern all over the country some states are lenient

1520
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,311
Summer super strict

1521
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:28,639
And both approaches seem to comply with Heller

1522
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,455
In a way the Heller Decision

1523
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:36,319
Is just like all those commas and Clauses that we started with and James Madison sentence

1524
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:37,855
It's the

1525
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,903
Confusing declaration

1526
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,975
That leaves the door wide open for interpretation

1527
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,303
Which

1528
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:47,839
Obviously sucks

1529
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,407
We could use a little more

1530
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,199
Clarity on

1531
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,991
How to live with this

1532
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,551
Second Amendment right to bear arms

1533
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:20,351
Open it gives us an opportunity I think

1534
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:26,751
Opportunity to get it right to fix it

1535
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:33,151
But now be pretty good time

1536
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:24,351

Drawn from

1540
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,471
Ice cold gun fight

1541
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:32,543
