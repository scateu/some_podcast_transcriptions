EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,959	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Explain why you think that
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:03,007	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Hateful speech fake news
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:04,799	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Shouldn't be protected by the first
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:07,871	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Can just admit it just agreed
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,663	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That we already regulates
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,431	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Speech at some love
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:16,063	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	So really all were debating about tonight the only thing that's even Up For Debate is where we want to draw that wine
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:19,135	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Henwood draw that line so it protects
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,159	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Nazis
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:23,231	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	I would draw that line so it protects
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:23,999	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Us
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:25,023	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	From the knot
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:28,607	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Let's start with a pretty simple example
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:29,887	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Fire
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,447	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Just kidding
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,775	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	I'm sure you've all heard that the thing that you can say
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:38,079	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Is that you can't shout fire on the crowded theater
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,359	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	But actually Under Armour

EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:52,159	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That's a very high bar
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:55,487	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	So I can probably say fire when I probably can't say is
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,511	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Fire
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,303	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Kill who you must to survive
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,863	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That would probably get me in
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:07,007	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	But the fire analogy comes from an older standard older than the one that I just quoted
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:09,311	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	It comes from Oliver Wendell Holmes
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:09,823	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Some of you might
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:14,943	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And his standard when he use the you can't falsely shout fire in a crowded theater

EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:18,271	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	His standard was false
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:19,295	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And dangerous
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,319	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Speech that is
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:22,111	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	False and dangerous

EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:30,559	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	I think that's where the Winans I think that's an eminently reasonable line I think that we had a hundred fifty years of a free republic with that line
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,607	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	So I want the line

EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:35,167	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Dangerous lies

EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:43,359	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Trip may I remind you we are currently led by a President
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:47,199	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Who thinks global warming is a Chinese hoax to Corner the tungsten
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:50,527	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And that's why I don't want the government deciding

EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:05,119	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Let's remember what he was talking about he was using that quote
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:06,655	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	You can't shout fire in a crowded
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:13,567	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	To justify jailing a man who is protesting World War II by handing out flyers suggesting that people

EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:17,663	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That was a clear danger that the government saw
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:19,199	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	If you don't think
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:21,247	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That is plausible
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:24,831	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That the government would be suppressing the same type of speech now if you gave it
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:26,623	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	The power if you handed it to them
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:27,647	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Out of fear of not
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:30,975	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Then just look at what happened after the protest

EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,031	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	They proposed

EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,551	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That's what the government does
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:57,087	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	With the power to suppress

EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:10,655	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	You want to talk about the Oliver Wendell Holmes case
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:12,959	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	What's talked about where our current standard come from
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:15,263	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	It's relatively recent 1969

EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:20,639	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Now what was that case I said 1969 you probably thought it was
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:23,967	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	We're making it know it was for Clans

EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:44,159	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Trying to wrestle with this issue when I go to the cops to try to ask

EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:42,591	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Whatever we think
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,383	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	About the First Amendment
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:46,175	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	It does Place limits on
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:46,687	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	The government
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:48,991	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	But not so much on Twitter
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:51,039	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Are Facebook so the question is
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:54,623	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Should Twitter and Facebook or other social media companies
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:57,183	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Severely limit online
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:00,511	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Or should they

EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:07,423	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Those of you people watching on Facebook
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:12,031	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Do you think the sight of which you are on right now should aggressively
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,055	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Limit
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,847	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	The speech that you might type
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:18,175	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Take take the online poll
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:23,039	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Desert in the audience same question should Facebook and Twitter be allowed to severely limit
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:25,343	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Online speech to find it as you will
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:32,767	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Okay doesn't you think he'll know
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:37,887	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	All right
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:38,911	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That's I guess
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:40,447	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	I got a kind of acid are mixed
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:46,335	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Santa where we're at in the audience okay so here to debate this topic with Ellie is Karin mcsherry
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:52,479	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation which is committed to defending civil liberties in a digital world give it up for her
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:58,111	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Alright so
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:02,463	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Corrine look start with you why what do you think about the prospect
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:04,767	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Twitter or Facebook stepping into
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,791	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	The takedown Liza
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:06,303	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Takedown hates
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:09,887	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	I think it's a very dangerous path
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,959	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Fortunately we're already well along
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:19,871	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	I think in moments of Crisis and I think we're in a moment of Crisis right now we look to Simple Solutions for very complex
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:20,639	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	6 problems
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,919	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And we are often
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:22,687	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Sorry
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:26,783	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And I think that is where we are right now the internet
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:27,807	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Grew up
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,855	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	The way it did for mostly good
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:30,879	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	I would argue
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:31,647	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Because
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:35,231	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	The platforms and the intermediaries mostly stayed
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:35,743	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Neutral
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:38,047	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	If we have a world in which
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:42,911	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Facebook Twitter Google Instagram put themselves in the position of a quart
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:44,703	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Decide what speed should be up
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:45,727	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	What speed shouldn't
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:48,543	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	We're going to walk down a dangerous path because
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:50,591	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Those decisions those tactics
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:51,871	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Wood evitable
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:52,895	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Be used
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:55,711	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Against speech that we would support
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:56,479	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	For one thing
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:58,015	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	They will be inevitably
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:18:01,855	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Used eventually by governments private censorship does not stay private
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:02,879	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	If it comes
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:03,903	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Public censorship
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:05,695	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Almost inevitably
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:07,743	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And the third reason is really practical
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:10,815	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	They're already doing it and they're doing it
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:11,583	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Badly
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:17,983	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	All kinds of Louisville speech is being taken down everyday Google and Facebook can't save us from the Nazis
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:18,751	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	We have to do it
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:22,335	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Okay thank you Korean Ellie what do you think
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:26,943	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	The First Amendment does not apply to Twitter or Facebook
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:30,015	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Anybody who tells you that they have a constitutional right
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:32,319	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	To say what they want on Twitter is an idiot
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:35,135	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Which waterfalls Waze
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:36,415	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	They don't just want
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:37,183	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Free speech
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:37,951	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	They want
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:39,231	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Consequence
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:40,255	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Free speech
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:42,815	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	They want to be able to say their vile trash
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:46,655	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And still keep their jobs and still keep their homes and still get the girl
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:48,703	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	These people
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,471	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	All right
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:53,055	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	We should have Twitter at least at the level of a Jets game
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:58,943	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Those are the basic sides
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:18:59,711	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Start
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:00,223	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	The debate
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:04,319	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Hiker and take us off
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:11,231	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	The problems here are legion and almost start with the ones that I that I just
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:12,511	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Touch on briefly before
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:14,047	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	The reality is
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:16,351	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That we can all target people that we hate right
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:22,751	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Right now but if we think that the rules that Twitter and Facebook and all those guys are going to come up with are going to be used
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:24,287	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	I guess the beach that we support
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:30,687	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	We are foolish it's already happening Community standards complaints are used against valuable speed all the time I know
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:33,247	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	No because I hear about it everyday in my

EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:45,535	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	We don't have any challenge
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:49,887	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	These performers have the right to host any speech they want they actually have the First Amendment right

EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:52,959	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	But
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:59,359	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	I think his users we want him to use that right wisely that's not happening right now
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:01,919	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	User I want them to stop Nazis
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:08,319	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That's really all I can learn about the and stop them from

EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:12,415	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	They can't that's foolish
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,439	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Sorry

EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:23,423	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Here's why you know what I know they can't because they're trying and they're failing over and over they cannot tell
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:28,799	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	The difference between hate speech and Reporting on high-speed get taken down and suspended
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:30,335	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	When they're doing perfectly
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,103	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Waffle
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:37,247	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	I think one of the reasons why this is so important that we demand better from Facebook from Twitter from Reddit
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:40,831	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Is that the reason why we're seeing so many more Nazis now
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:43,391	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Is because of these platforms have allowed them to organize
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:46,207	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	There was a reason why
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:48,511	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	The clan was on the decline
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:49,791	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	20 years ago
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:53,631	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Because you because wearing a hood and going out to meet your friends the middle
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:55,423	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Feel by Brandenburg did
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:57,727	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Wasn't really how the modern society was going
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:21:00,799	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Expedition Twitter and Facebook and the site and read it came along
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:02,591	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And now they have a way to talk
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:07,967	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Talk to each other and realize that no I actually hate black people too though so do I let's hang out
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:10,783	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	No screw these people there's no there's no cost
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:17,184	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Too Short reason why Twitter should allow them to exist or Facebook or whatever there is no business reason why Twitter or face
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:17,952	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Whatever she allowed
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:20,768	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Get them the F out
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,304	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	You know what I think I think about it
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:25,120	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	One of these we heard in the wake of Charlottesville with a lot of
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:26,656	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Please folks got radicalized online
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:32,032	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	So why would the prospect of them getting radicalized online what would bounce set out in terms of the
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:32,544	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Failure
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,336	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That these sites are doing
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,360	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	I'm curious if you talk more about
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,664	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Okay so a couple things I just want to respond to
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:45,088	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	My view is if white supremacist and clansmen and Nazis are organizing I weigh before they were doing it out in
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:50,464	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Public where I can see them and I can challenge them and I can respond to them and law enforcement will say the exact
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:51,232	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Same
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:55,840	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Think people who fight terrorism say it's much better for the for the you know the
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:59,680	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	People to speaking publicly for the radical to be radicalizing where you can see them
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:01,984	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	They're going to organize anyway
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:02,752	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Okay
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:09,152	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	So would you rather do with a student secret on the open I prefer.
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:11,200	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Going finally make their own Nazi website
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:14,272	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Wright's make your own Nazi thing right so that when
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:16,576	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Whenever I get tense agree with me
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:22,976	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Whatever the government is ready to stop these people still of all pre-registered they would have all said

EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:33,216	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	So we can continue The Silo conversation that we're having right now which is a big part of where I want to see you try
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,496	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	I think that's
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:41,408	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That sounds very nice and it's a good talking point but in reality I think that's very very dangerous for our society we need
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:47,808	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	People to be talking to each other when they only talk to people who agree with them they never change their mind
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:54,208	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Proven time and time again I feel like that is such
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:55,232	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	A happy
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:23:01,632	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Slappy white version of this story of if we just talked to these people we can convince them that maybe black people
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:03,424	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Shouldn't be sent off to prison camp
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:10,592	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Once or twice and the rest of the time they're running cars in the people it doesn't happen nearly not long enough
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:12,128	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	We have gay marriage equality now
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:12,640	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Because people talk
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:20,064	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	But it helps what I want to answer Jazz question cuz I think what you're asking is for an
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:24,416	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Example of why I'm worried about how I wanted you are worried against Elie's work
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:26,976	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	So the weather works
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:34,144	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Mountain and the way that is likely to continue to work as this other social media companies employ a combination of humans and
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:37,472	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Mostly algorithms to try to figure out what's bad speech and what's good
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:38,752	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And they
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:39,264	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Message
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:44,640	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	So they end up taking down this statement all white people are racist
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:47,200	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	As an example of hate speech but they won't take down
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:51,040	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Puma show the previous ones this from a congressman
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:56,416	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Who said not a single radicalized Islamic suspect should be granted enter measure of quarter
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:59,744	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Etcetera etcetera nasty stuff right they can't tell the difference
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:06,400	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And that's what happens in there is an app tips Republic I hope you guys are all propublica supporters and fans cuz they're great
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:09,216	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	They did a detailed study to look at Facebook
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:09,984	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Whose policies
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:13,312	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And they found out that among other things their training their moderators
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:15,872	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	2 in some instances protect white men
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:17,152	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Over black children
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:23,040	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Yes where we are right now that's what we want to endorse that's we want to encourage I don't
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:26,880	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	I will stipulate that there are many examples of them
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:30,464	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Getting it wrong they get it wrong or not great at this
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:30,976	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Job yet
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:35,584	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	But we live in a real world where the actual not talk about Twitter
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:36,608	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	We live in the world
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:38,144	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Were the actual cops
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:42,240	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Get it wrong every freaking day and in my most radical statement
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:44,288	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	I'm not saying let's get rid of the cops
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,080	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Cuz they don't know what they're doing
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:51,200	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	No I'm saying let's get better cops and for Twitter I'm saying let's get better Twitter
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:53,760	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	So they don't get it wrong some
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:56,320	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Do you want to talk about letting the perfect be the enemy of the good
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:25:00,160	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Just because Twitter and Facebook have not gotten to the level
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:02,976	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Yet whether able to effectively police seized
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:05,280	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Doesn't mean they should just stop trying
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:08,352	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	What we have where we are right now is
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:09,632	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Thousands of accounts
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:10,912	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Are being suspended
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:11,936	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Everyday
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:16,288	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Let's just say a relatively small percentage of those are for perfectly lawful
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:18,592	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That's a lot of waffles Peach
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:20,640	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That's a lot that we have authorized
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:27,552	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Twitter and Facebook and everyone else to take them and encourage them to and keep in mind I want to say one more thing that I said before but I'm
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:28,576	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Want to emphasize it
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:30,368	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Once we start down this path
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:36,768	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	You think that this is going to stay within the decision-makers at Silicon Valley you are dreaming I mean that's bad enough I'm not actually sure why
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:37,536	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Why we all want
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:39,584	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Silicon Valley to make decisions about what's pee
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,352	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Peaches okay for
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:41,120	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	All the rest of us
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:43,936	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	What even got to start it's not going to stop there
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:46,240	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Governments are going to come in when they see
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:49,056	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That Google Facebook Twitter can easily take down
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:50,848	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Accounts they're going to say okay
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:51,872	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Could you do that for us
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:53,408	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	This doesn't
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:26:00,064	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Somebody needs to stop these people and I refuse to believe that we live in a country where
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:03,392	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Take question here in the back
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:08,512	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	If Facebook emailed you and said you can be in charge of what
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:10,048	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Considered you know
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:11,328	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	A speech that is either less
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,352	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Afdah poorest
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:13,888	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Taken down you could build
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:15,680	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	You know whatever team of people
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:16,704	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Would you accept
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:17,728	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That would you think that
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:18,240	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	But that could
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:20,288	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Create something that
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:21,568	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	You would be satisfied with or not
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:23,616	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Ofo
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:24,640	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	I was Queen of the world
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:27,200	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Hard to turn that down
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:32,832	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	I think even I would have trouble in all instances being perfect about what was
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:39,744	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Loss of speech and what wasn't sweet but that actually isn't my main concern is that even I could then potentially be required by a
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,256	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	The government
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:43,072	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	2 then use that algorithm
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:48,448	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	For other purposes and I'll be really dangerous but here's the one thing that I would say in this is where I think we agree
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:50,752	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Is that if I was Queen of the world
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:52,800	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And I was
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:57,408	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Running any of these companies one of the things I would absolutely do
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:59,200	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Is putting much better
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:26:59,968	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Processes for
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:03,808	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Appeal for people to challenge when things are taking down rocks
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:04,832	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	This isn't just a
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:05,600	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Speech issue
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:07,392	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	It's a due process issue because
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,160	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Let's face it
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:14,304	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Of course these aren't you know official government forms we all understand that but nonetheless this is how we talk to each other
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:16,352	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	These are our public spaces
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:22,240	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And in this public spaces it's really important when your account get suspended when you get taken offline
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:23,520	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	To be able to
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:26,080	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Get back up what you're doing is perfectly legal
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:28,896	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And right now the reality is and I know this cuz I hear from him
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:30,176	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	All the time
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:36,064	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	It's very confusing you don't know who to appeal to you don't know who you don't know why you're taking down half the time
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:37,088	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And you don't know what
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:39,136	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	What to do on the far right
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:43,232	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Hi I just wanted to get your opinions on
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:44,512	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Money
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:46,304	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Because I hear a lot of talk about the
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:47,072	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Does being
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:51,424	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	A speech issue or not but I think we're platforms the social media platforms I think it's
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:52,448	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Really all about money
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,216	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And it's about
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:53,728	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Followers
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:56,288	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And young kids are getting rape threats and
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:59,360	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Threats and that they eventually
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:01,920	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	End in suicide I think that this has to do
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:02,944	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	With money I think there's
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:03,968	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	A bigger issue
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:05,504	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And I just don't
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:07,296	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Hear anyone talking about it and I just wanted to know
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:08,576	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Thought about that
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:12,672	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	I think that that's that's really a real pressure point cuz I think
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:14,464	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Elijah Cummings
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:15,744	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Genuinely so
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:17,792	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Do you want comfortable making money from
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:18,560	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	From hate
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:23,168	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	But unfortunately we still have a problem and I'm going to give you a sample from an article I just read yes
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:29,568	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Conversation Piece about Google and how it runs advertising and search and so on
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:31,104	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	From talking points memo
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:36,224	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Talking points memo mentioned that you know one of the problems that they have because these processes are so a pig
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:38,272	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	They survived because of Google advert
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:43,136	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Them to write their legitimate site trying to do good for the world they survive because of Google app
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:45,184	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Advertising they keep getting penalized
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:47,232	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	For hate speech because they're reporting
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:48,256	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	On hate speech
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:49,792	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Specifically Dillon

EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:51,584	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Situation
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:55,168	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	So y'all read the robot.
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:29:00,032	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	But no it is because we agree to the robots are bad but I think that we can all agree that talking points memo
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:01,824	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Is a decent site
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:08,224	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Infowars on Heather had if Google and Facebook and whatever slam them
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:11,552	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Why would that why would that be so hard
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:13,344	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	If you really don't think
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:17,440	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That we yet have the technology and the resources necessary
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:18,208	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	In order to
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:19,744	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Police
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:21,280	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	These sites better
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:23,584	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	How about we go the other direction how about we just out
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:24,352	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	People
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:30,752	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	How about you just if you can if you're going to view Twitter going to tell me you can't tell who's threatening to kill me
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:31,520	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Just tell me where it is
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:33,824	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Just tell me who it is and I will handle it myself
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:37,408	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	What's wrong with that
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:40,736	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	See now he's just trying to piss me off
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:46,624	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	So we're talking about is now a step further its
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:49,440	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Social media companies and intermediaries by the way all the
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:50,976	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	People that you interact with
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:52,512	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	They take it upon themselves
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:53,536	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Two out yet
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:55,072	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Write to pierce your anonymity
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:57,888	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That is profoundly profoundly dangerous
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:30:03,264	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Anonymity Anonymous speech is the most probably the most important form of political speech that we have
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,032	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	The ability
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:05,312	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	To speak
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:06,336	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Especially online
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:10,688	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Without fear retaliation means that you have the ability to speak your truth
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:12,992	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	If we out people if we
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:13,760	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Except
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:17,344	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That social media companies should be judge and jury over that should just
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:22,464	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Expose people to the world without any choice without any recourse because once your outage
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:26,560	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Sting to have a society
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:27,584	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Protect ourselves
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:28,352	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	From these people
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:29,888	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	It's called Shame
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:31,168	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	We could
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:34,496	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Shame them into being part of the her
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:40,128	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	If I didn't want to be part of the hurt we could know who they are and say hey guess what you're no longer part of the hurt
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:45,248	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Shame is a powerful weapon that we used to have a Twitter is taken away from us
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:46,272	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And that is why these
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:47,552	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	These people are allowed
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:48,576	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	2 *
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:54,976	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	That weapon was also used to persecute minorities all over there and everything was always you
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:31:01,376	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Minorities at some point
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:03,424	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	We used to stop naughty that's just a
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:09,568	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Walkthrough used to persecute minorities when they were paid by the hour or I'll call you from a good thing
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:14,176	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	The one thing we have always understood in this country and this is before the 1st Amendment
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:15,968	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Is the importance

EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:20,832	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	All right let me just jump in for so I can leave out weave a question here on the right
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:21,856	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	I just want to say that like
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:24,928	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Is there a moral reason
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:26,464	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Twitter
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:27,744	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	The government
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:29,280	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	Lean towards
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:31,840	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And I personally am someone who

EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:44,896	| moreperfect110617_thehatedebate |	And it was
