EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:34,368	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	You may have heard of all this
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:40,768	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	It's been covered quite a bit
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:46,656	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	It really left into a lot of people's Consciousness back in 2014 when this guy Shabazz Napier
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:49,728	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Who was the star player for the University of Connecticut said
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:50,752	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	During an interview
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:55,360	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	I go to bed and I'm starving
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:56,640	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	He didn't have enough money to eat
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:59,456	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	And this was just a few days before
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:06,368	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Keeping score 22 points and Lead UConn to win the national championship
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,928	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Neuropathy feel like
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:12,000	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	You want something in return
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:12,512	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	For all of this
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:14,560	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Is Eric
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:25,056	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	There are not what some people arguing
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:27,872	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Because the ideal of the traditional ideal
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:31,456	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Or that people play for the love of the sport
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,992	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	And not for financial
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:36,576	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	And this was somehow spoil that somehow
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,600	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Paying them enough to eat
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:38,624	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Would spoil
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:44,512	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Now interestingly if you survey people on this issue which we did
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:47,840	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Hand washing posters alphabet I think that they should get paid
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:54,496	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	How much do you get paid
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:04:00,896	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	I definitely feel like you should get paid job and you're a student you have to be full-time as well so that's
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:04,224	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Bessie two full-time jobs
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:07,040	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	They still profit margin on them is way too high
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,832	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	What you'll find is that
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:14,208	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	A majority of black people who are surveyed
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:22,655	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	On the other hand you think I should get paid no absolutely not how come
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:27,775	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Because they're college students will find that most white people about
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,799	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	6 out of 10
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:29,567	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Jose
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:30,335	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	No
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:34,687	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	I kind of believe they are getting paid by Guinea scholarship
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:38,271	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	I think if they're on a full scholarship that's
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:40,319	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	A lot more pay then
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,087	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Any other
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:41,855	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	College

EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:46,975	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	I really really don't think so
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:49,535	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Ellie again
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:52,095	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	All of what my head always goes back to is
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:56,191	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	There's a lot of this conversation that should have been settled
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:58,495	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	And it should have been settled
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:01,567	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	In 1865
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:03,615	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	When we pass the 13th amend
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:04,895	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	13th Amendment
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:07,199	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Abolition of slavery
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:08,735	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Neither slavery
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:11,295	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Nor involuntary servitude
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:15,647	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Except as a punishment for Crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:16,415	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Shall exist
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:18,207	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Within the United States
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:21,023	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Any place subject to their jurisdiction
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:25,119	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Okay so what does NCAA basketball have to do with the 13th Amendment
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:30,239	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Well the 13th amendment was ratified after the end of the Civil War it abolished
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:32,287	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Slavery involuntary servitude
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:33,055	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	But there's
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,335	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Sort of disastrous
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,103	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	That says
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:39,455	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Except as a punishment for Crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:42,783	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Involuntary servitude is okay if you are in prison
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:48,415	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	This is why states can use prisoners to build roads and fight fires and do all kinds of things
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,951	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	And not have to come
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:57,631	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	And believe it or not this is what the NCAA indirectly cited as a way to defend their practice
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:01,215	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Back in 2016
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:02,495	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	2 Penn State runners
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:04,799	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Sue the NCAA saying they should get paid
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:08,895	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals came back with a verdict saying no
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,663	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	They don't have to pay you
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:14,271	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	In the reasoning the judge appointed to a case about prisoners not getting paid
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:15,295	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Because of the 13th amend
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:17,343	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Understandably
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:20,927	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	This comparison between NCAA athlete
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:21,951	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	In prisoners
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,231	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Made a lot of people
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:26,815	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Bentley has a racial overtone
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,607	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Because we're not talking about this in hockey
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:30,143	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	And baseball nowicki
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:32,191	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Conveniently having this conversation
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:34,239	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	About the two sports in particular
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,775	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	Basketball and football
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:37,311	| moreperfect102418_themostperfectalbumepfive |	That are predominantly black
