EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:11,488	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	And to make a long story short
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:13,536	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	The case ends up at the
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:14,560	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:16,096	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	I cannot imagine being taken
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:17,376	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Supreme Court so what is your
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:18,656	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Your feeling when you find that
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:20,448	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Well
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:22,496	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Always wanted to go
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:24,288	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Was hoping it was under different circumstances
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:27,104	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	But at this point this is a lot bigger
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:28,896	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Like
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:29,920	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Knowing how long

EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:33,504	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Case could very well just

EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:02,848	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Until
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:03,616	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	June 19th
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:04,896	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Mm
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:11,296	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	I woke up and there were like 760 notifications on my phone
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:12,320	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Indie rock band
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:13,344	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	The Slants
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:19,744	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Will be allowed to trademark their name
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:21,024	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	A long time to trademark
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:23,328	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	And we found out that it was
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:25,376	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Unanimous in our favor
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:27,424	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	And so
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:37,920	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	That is how the slant ended up doing an impromptu unplugged
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:39,200	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Set on the steps of the
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:40,736	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:56,608	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Interestingly some people in the wake of that
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:37:58,912	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Decision speculated that the Washington Redskins
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:01,728	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Of all people would benefit from this landscape
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:04,032	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Teams trademark had been denied
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:05,824	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Because many Native American
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:07,104	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Felt it was derogatory
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:09,664	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	In a couple weeks after this last victory
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:11,456	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	The denial of their trademark was avoided
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:13,760	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	It's so like everything
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:15,296	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:17,088	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	But for our purpose
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:20,928	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Out of the laundry list of American bands that have
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:21,696	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Spoken out
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:22,464	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Against the Federal
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:24,768	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	The Slants are the only ones
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:26,048	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	To our knowledge
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:26,816	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	To go to the
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:27,328	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:28,352	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	And when
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:30,144	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Any unanimous
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:30,656	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Decision
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:32,192	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Obviously
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:35,264	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	When we decided we were doing this amendments album
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:38,080	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	The Slants were one of the first bands that we reached out to
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:38,848	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Yasso
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:40,128	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	View original approach
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:41,152	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	To do the
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:42,176	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	The album and I think
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:44,736	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Requested to write a song about
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:46,528	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	The First Amendment because
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:49,088	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Yeah we we had such a direct experience with that
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:51,136	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	But I thought it was a little
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:51,904	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	2
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:52,672	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Obvious
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:53,696	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Is pressed juicery
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:59,072	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	And then I started thinking about the different amendments and how I always wanted
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:00,352	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	To do something around
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:02,400	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	The 18th and 21st Amendment
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:04,960	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Which is of course prohibition 18th Amendment
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:06,496	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Prohibition of liquor
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:08,288	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	And then what eventually revoked is
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:09,056	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	21st Amendment
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:11,104	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Repeal of prohibition
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:13,152	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Because I always just found it really fascinating
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:14,688	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	The history of round
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:15,968	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	I mean
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:18,784	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	The reason why prohibition didn't really work us because
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:22,624	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	And all of the people didn't accept it so kind of shows
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:24,672	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	That when you kind of stomp out certain rights
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:25,184	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Some people feel our
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:28,256	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Parent they kind of find ways around it anyway
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:29,792	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	And then
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:30,304	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Hi
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:33,376	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Thought of this idea which I shared my
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:37,216	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Guitar player I said what if we use 18 and 21 with a metaphor
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:37,728	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	44 age
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:39,008	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Because
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:41,568	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	When we turn 18 we assume that we
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:42,848	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Have all these rights
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:43,616	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Like you have the right to
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:44,384	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Vote
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:47,200	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	You can buy cigarettes or other things we can't drink
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:50,272	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	So you actually don't have your full set of like
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:56,416	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Adult rights until you turn 21 and so I shared that with him and my guitarist Joe
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:57,952	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Started writing
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:58,720	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	The song
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:40:00,000	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Code 1821
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:02,048	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Which is basically
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:08,192	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Kind of about that about growing up in and the disillusionment the loss of Innocence that's what I think
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:18,080	| moreperfect_extras101218_themostperfectalbumep4 |	Oh man the Slants killed it I love that song it's such an Anthem
