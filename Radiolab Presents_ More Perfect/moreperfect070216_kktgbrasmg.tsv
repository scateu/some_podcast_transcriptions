EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:46,591	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Actually it was Marshall and Jefferson
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:49,151	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Who really despised each other
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:54,527	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	And yet they both come from Virginia they both come from the backcountry

EDL	00:08:57,087	00:09:03,487	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Family beef at one point John Marshall's wife's mother rejected Thomas Jefferson

EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:20,383	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Cuz they were in opposite political party
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:23,455	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	I think an important thing to understand about Marshall is that he's a party man
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:27,807	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Okay party man likes to party
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,623	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Committed to his team

EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:51,103	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Or maybe even a favor The View that states can veto a federal law if they don't like it at least two guys please
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:51,871	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Two cousins

EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:54,687	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Totally different philosophies
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:56,479	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Even before Marshall hits the court
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:58,783	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	They're going
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:02,623	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Baby Fenty Beauty and the Beast actually a slugfest to paraphrase
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:03,903	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Marshall you're dishonest
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:08,767	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Jefferson you're a hack Marshall you and your friends are poisoning America dislike
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:14,143	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	That is a food fight it's very difficult to stop the tendency to view the people that you disagree with as
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:22,079	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	As Eve
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:24,127	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	You're really hard we do that today all the time right
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:27,967	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	They even as much if not more than today
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:30,783	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	They thought that the other side was trying to destroy
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,063	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	The Americas they just create
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:36,671	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Anyway
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:43,839	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Drive to 1790 the Federalist or empower the Federalist holes all the dino branches
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,399	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	John Adams
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:48,447	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	President mostly love poison party
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,727	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Hated by Thomas Jefferson
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:54,847	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	They literally call him like his rotundity very offencive
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:11:01,247	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	So out of the power and ultimately our guy John Marshall Marshall as Secretary of State when the highest officials in the oven
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:02,783	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Station you know Hardiman

EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:08,159	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	But then

EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:16,863	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Thomas Jefferson

EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:23,775	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	The Federalist
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,567	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Like Landslide Crush
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,079	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Yeah
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,103	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Fleetwood Mac
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:31,711	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	The Republicans ran the table in 1800 they're going to take over the house
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:36,063	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	What do I do
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:37,343	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	We need to save the Republic
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:40,159	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	The Federalist have basically been swept out
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:42,207	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	But in his dire moment he has to say
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:42,719	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Idealista
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,791	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	How old is the White House
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,583	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	The Supreme Court
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:53,727	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Supreme Court normally nobody cares about the Supreme Court but like in this moment you thinking oh my gosh this is my last hope
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:56,799	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	As luck would have it a vacancy pops
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:58,335	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Avakin Chief just
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:11:59,359	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Position
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:00,895	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	So just as
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:03,711	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Majestically has recently died and there's a vacancy well
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:09,343	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Sitting chief justice Oliver Ellsworth steps down and Adams picks his secretary of state
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:11,135	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	John Marshall
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,415	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	To be the new
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,183	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Chief
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:13,951	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Justice
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:15,743	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	That's how we got John Marshall
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:17,791	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	And John Adams is one other thing
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:22,143	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	In the waning seconds of espresso
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:27,263	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Adams and Eves repudiated Federalist jam through a whole bunch of federal judgeship
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:31,615	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	They create scores and new judges and they throw Federalist into almost all of this position
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:38,015	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	E-40 appointment he just throws in 40 judges right at the last minute to recreate sporty judges at the last minute and
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:41,855	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Then he appoints Jefferson I would be
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:44,927	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Ask Jordan is pissed a second
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:48,255	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	But in the meantime Adams have just a few days left in
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:51,071	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	His presidency so he's like frantically trying to get all these judges
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:55,935	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Nominated people off confirm then once you confirm someone you have to let give them their Commission
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:13:00,799	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	You can just go around claiming you're a judge or claiming your paperwork
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:01,823	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Formal seal
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,871	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Signature of the president
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:04,639	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	End
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:08,479	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	As story goes as the clock is striking midnight on John Adams
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:13,855	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Last day Adams is teen there in his office then try and get these papers out the door there
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:15,903	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Frantically signing them stamping them
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:22,815	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	It's imagine like youngboy sprinting to the dead of night over their head
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:29,215	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Like I think totally apocryphal story is that Jefferson's attorney-general like
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:30,495	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Dorit midnight Netflix
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,775	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Put down your pen
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:36,383	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	But apparently some of the commission's don't deliver
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:39,967	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	They just are left
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:40,735	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Sitting on the dash
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:46,879	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Because it wasn't like an oversight or something it's not even like
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:50,463	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	I thought like if a couple or left on the desk it's no big deal
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:57,119	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	It's a sign commission from the president it's like still a binding talking the fact that it wasn't formally delivered you know
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:58,399	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	You still get your
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,167	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	So
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:03,519	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Kind of terrible situation for Jefferson he shows up the next day
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:08,127	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	To take power and the Judiciary is
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:10,943	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Filled with ghosts of presidential appointees pass
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:13,503	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Just a Bastion of
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,271	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Partisan judge
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,647	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	So
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:20,927	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	As you can imagine
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,975	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Jefferson and his friends think that this

EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:27,936	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Without Bloodshed in the streets and whatever
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:30,240	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Good for us
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:32,288	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	How do we actually get to that point
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:34,336	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	And this is a key reason why we
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:37,920	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Because the decisions of the past administration
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:40,992	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Still hold value even when that Administration
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:42,784	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Is kicked out of office
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:44,064	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Overthrown
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:45,344	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	By popular vote
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:46,368	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Their decision
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:49,184	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Still have still have sway still have a legal Force
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:51,232	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Jefferson was
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,024	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	White
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:53,792	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Obviously
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:55,584	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Negating that
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:58,912	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Marshall wants to say that a person you know
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,936	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Suck it up cousin
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:02,496	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Give this guy his papers official
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:03,008	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Do your job
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:04,544	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	But he thinks twice
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:05,824	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	She understands how weak
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:07,616	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	1480 alkmaar
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:10,688	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Marshall's afraid that if he orders Jefferson to give over those papers
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:15,296	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Jefferson is going to straight up laughing his face and say you and what army I'm not going to do it
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:17,856	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Literally they just got back from a
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:22,976	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Congressionally mandated you can't come to work time Jefferson nose
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:24,000	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Bulwell
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:26,304	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	But he has no intention of granting that
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:28,352	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	He will never
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:28,864	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Give that
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:30,400	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Jefferson nose
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:31,424	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Marshall Motors
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:33,728	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Marshall knows if he tell Jefferson
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:38,592	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	To give him the commission Jefferson is going to ignore him and in the power of the Supreme Court
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:40,640	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Basically evaporate
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:43,712	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Ellie says like if you think about it
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:49,600	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	If executive branch is going to say kind of right at the jump it if you make a decision that I don't like I'm just going to ignore that
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:51,648	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Then every executive branch
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:54,208	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Going on from Jefferson
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:57,024	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Throughout the rest of our history is going to just ignore this
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:59,328	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Supreme Court when the Supreme Court.
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:00,864	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	That the executive.
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:02,400	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	So basically Marshall
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:03,424	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Pasta
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:10,336	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	If you rules for Jefferson he's selling out the lot he's going to make
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:11,104	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	The court look weak
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:13,920	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Heroes against Jefferson
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:15,712	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Jefferson can ignore the court
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,480	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	And
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:17,248	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	They're going to look weak
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:19,808	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Either way Jefferson
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:21,344	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	And by the way
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:22,368	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:24,160	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Maybe disappears forever
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:27,232	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Marshall needed to find a way
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:29,792	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	I'm to get through that he needed to
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:31,328	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Find some way to kick this case
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:33,120	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	To be clear John Marshall
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:35,936	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Running away from a fight with Thomas Jefferson
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:37,472	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	He says all true thing
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:38,752	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	He knows the times Jeff
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:41,056	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Since you know straight up has more power
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:42,080	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	And so he's retreating
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:45,664	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Wow it's like suddenly feels like apocalyptical moment
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:48,480	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	What does he do well so the thing that he does
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:49,760	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	It's like
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,040	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	The most
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:52,576	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Jedi Master s thing ever
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:24:00,256	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	How did something page decision in in the beginning
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:02,560	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	It's a lot of pages
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:05,120	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	How is wrong
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:06,912	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	How he can't do what he did
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:12,032	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	How he is ruining America
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:14,848	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	A lot of that in the Marshall decision
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:17,408	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	But then when he gets to the matter at hand
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:19,456	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	He doesn't little
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:21,504	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Ship
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:24,320	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	She says okay hold up yes
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:27,904	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Barbary is right you should have gotten that Commission
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:31,488	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	And yes mr. Jefferson should not be doing this
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:34,048	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	We the Supreme Court jurist
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:35,072	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	To hear that
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:39,424	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Court needs to have the power to hear a case
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:42,240	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	If a court doesn't have the power to hear a case
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:45,312	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Even if you were completely right
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:46,592	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Even if your position is
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:48,384	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	You can't get relief
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:51,712	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Wait why would he say that they don't have jurisdiction
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:55,296	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	This is like where he uses the force
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:25:00,160	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	You know earlier I mentioned that Marbury brought this case under a law Congress has passed
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:02,464	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	It's at Marbury to come straight to the
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:04,512	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Work like for this kind of situation
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:05,536	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Well
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:07,328	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	John Marshall he goes back to the
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:12,192	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Figure out like what he can do here
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:16,032	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	He finds his little sentence with article 3 section
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:20,640	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Two in the Constitution that says like basically you're not supposed to go to the
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:23,200	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Supreme Court first you're supposed to go to a different
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:24,736	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	And then
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:30,368	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Of course it's an appeals court exactly but but he basically tells Marbury the point
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:32,672	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	You came in and you came to the Supreme Court first
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:34,464	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	And
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:38,816	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	You did that because Congress passed a law that said that you could come to the Supreme Court first
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,352	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	But
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:41,888	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	The Constitution says
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:43,168	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	That you can't come to
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:44,192	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Supreme Court first
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:45,216	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	So I can't help you
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:48,544	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Is that your fault mr. Marbury but that law was unconstitutional
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:50,848	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	And we're not going to follow that.
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:52,128	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Digital director
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:53,152	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Si see what you did there
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:26:02,112	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Maybe I see I don't know in Star Wars
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:05,440	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	The first one where Obi-Wan Kenobi is fighting with Darth Vader
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:11,072	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	He says
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:14,144	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	This like that
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:15,680	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	But real
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:18,240	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Marshall is agreeing to lose
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:20,288	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	He's like found this way to lose
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:25,408	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Like let Darth Vader strike them down to make it more powerful he's basically saying to his cousin
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:28,224	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Okay you don't have to give her a breeze
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:28,992	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Commission
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:33,600	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	And the reason you don't have to give Barbara his commission is his cuz that law doesn't work
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,880	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Because we
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:35,648	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	The court
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:37,696	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	We get to decide
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:39,744	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	When something agrees with or doesn't agree with console
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:41,792	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	So like to grass

EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:29,824	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Take you for granted

EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:56,704	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	When the court got its power because
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:59,520	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	It really depends on what you mean when you say power
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:05,152	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	I guess we were talking with our legal editor Elena Stalin
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:07,968	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Constitutional scholar
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:10,016	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	They both said like look what happens after this case
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:12,064	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	30 years down the road is
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:13,600	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	John Marshall
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:16,928	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Still the Chief Justice he gets into a dust-up with Andrew Jackson
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:19,232	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Message Jackson were talking about so generally it was
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:22,560	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	I would like to do horrible things Native Americans
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:25,120	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	You probably shouldn't do horrible things the Native Americans
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:30,240	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	I don't remember asking you a god
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:31,264	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Damn thing
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:38,176	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Essentially had a situation where Marshall makes ruling saying we have to respect Native American sovereignty and Jackson family
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,712	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Supposedly
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:40,224	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	That we don't know if
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:42,784	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	True I think it's more fun to believe that
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,064	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Did say that
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:44,832	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	It works better than me
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:49,440	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Now let them enforce it
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:53,280	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	John Marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:59,680	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	To make a long sad story short you get the Trail of Tears thousands of Native Americans were marched off their land
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:06,080	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	There's evidence that they were purposefully move during the winter so that more people would die along the way so well
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:07,616	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	The court maybe had constant
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:09,920	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	2-channel Authority it didn't have a key
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:10,432	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Actual power
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:17,344	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Until or just got here on this and that the students are in the 1950s

EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:48,320	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Although maybe not
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:50,368	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	I don't know what time

EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:00,512	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Can make these laws
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:02,304	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	But if the people
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:05,120	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Aren't willing to go along with
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,912	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	With and what do these laws mean
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:11,008	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	I think ultimately I agree with learning Han

EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:01,952	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	As it turns out
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:02,464	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	The top
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:05,024	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Vast majority of Americans like 60

EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:07,584	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Cannot name a single Supreme God
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:08,096	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	For justice
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:12,960	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	We also found them when we went out and a lot of people had no idea how many justices
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:13,984	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	There are
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:16,288	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Do not know how many Supreme Court justices
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:22,432	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	17 Supreme Court judges

EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:30,112	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	We think we should know about these people
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:30,880	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	We should at least
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:31,648	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Know their names
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:33,440	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	So the title of this podcast
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:35,232	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	Is a mnemonic device
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:37,536	| moreperfect070216_kktgbrasmg |	To help you remember the names
